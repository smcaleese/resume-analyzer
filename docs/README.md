All of your documentation should be placed in subdirectories of this directory.

- Use the `proposal` sub-directory for your project proposal.
- Use the `functional-spec` sub-directory for your functional specification.
- Use the `documentation` sub-directory for your user manual and technical documentation.
- Use the `video-walk-through` sub-directory for you video walk through.

There are additional instructions in each of those sub-directories.  Please read them.

** Excluding the proposal document, The general rule of thumb that you should 
adopt is that documents should be converted to PDF when finalised - and
available for collection from your repo in time for the appropriate deadlines.
While templates are provided in MS Word format, individual students may select
whichever editing software they prefer - the only constraint is that
the final revision of these documents should be converted to PDF.**
