# **1. Introduction**
## 1.1 Overview
The product we are developing is a web application which will allow a user to upload a CV/resume. The system will carry out a suite of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis analytics on the resume extracting key information such as skills, technologies, certifications and prior employment. This information will then be processed alongside aggregate job market data to produce helpful information such as recommended skills which will make the user more attractive to potential employers and also potential career paths. With this information we hope to help the user make informed choices when navigating their career decisions.

# **2. General Description**
## 2.1 Product Functions
The product will be a web application which a user will be able to upload a CV to. This CV will be sent to the systems backend where first it will be processed using machine learning and NLP to extract key terms and information about the user, this information will include (but may not be limited to) certifications, skills, characteristics, technologies and employment history. This data will then be analysed by the system which will make use of its collection of aggregate job market data (job listings, linkedin profiles, etc.) to analyse the users provided information to evaluate how well their CV will fare in the current job market. It will then return helpful information to the user like what skills or certifications will be most beneficial in progressing their career, what are some potential career paths they can pursue (and what steps are needed) and other useful information to help the user improve their CV and progress their career. This information  will then be displayed to the user as well as allowing the user to see jobs that they are most suited for with their current skill set and apply to any which take their interest.

## 2.2 User Characteristics and Objectives
This product will be targeted towards people who are beginning their career path such as new graduates, young people aged 18 - 30 and people who are looking to make a career change. This user base will have a wide range of technical abilities and experience and as such the system will need to be accomodating to people of all levels of technical expertise. However we do expect our users to have a basic functional understanding of using and interacting with web applications. We will also be exclusively targeting English speakers as the product will only be able to handle English language CVs and thus we will only have the application available in English.

From a user's perspective, using the system should be as straightforward as navigating to the URL using a modern web browser of their choice. Uploading a CV through a clearly marked upload section and clicking a button to being the processing. There will be a short delay (No more than 30-40 seconds) as processing takes place and then the screen will change to display the output information to the user. From here the user is free to navigate and explore the displayed information and interact with any interactive information displayed like navigating to job listing of jobs that were deemed the most suitable for them.

## 2.3 Operational Scenarios

<br>

## 2.4 Constraints
Development of this system will have to abide by the following constraints.
* **Time constraints:** Developement and deployment of the project must be complete before April 2022.
* **Financial constraints:** The project will have little to no budget and thus will not be able to make use of any expensive services such as hosting or paid for development tools/subscriptions.
* **Processing constraints:** Due to the aforementioned budget constraint the computing and storage capability of the host system will be severely limited and may lead to poor user experience.
* **Legal constraints:** THe product will be taking in user data and thus the product must be in accordance with European and International regulations for data management, data storage and data protections.
* **Platform constraints:** The product is a web application and as such must be developed with modern browser capabilities in mind. These browsers will have different features and capabilities which the product must be able to adapt to for a constant user experience. 
* **Traffic constraints:** Due to budget and processing limitations the system will not be able to handle large amounts of users accessing the product at once.
