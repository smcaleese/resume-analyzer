            "description": "Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. Etsy, Inc.'s 'house of brands' portfolio has expanded to now include four individually distinct ecommerce brands – Etsy, fashion resale marketplace Depop, musical instrument marketplace Reverb, and Brazil-based handmade goods marketplace Elo7. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact. About the Team Etsy is seeking a Senior Software Engineer to join our International Experience team. We’re a multi-functional group of engineering, product management, design, research, and analytics. Our team has two primary responsibilities. First, ensuring that key product development infrastructure is properly localised such as our internal taxonomy, locale management, formatting libraries, etc. Second, that all products & marketing tools are integrated into our human translation systems, ensuring that Etsy fluently speaks to every buyer and seller in their chosen language. Here’s a taste of the problems we’re solving: How can we ensure that every Etsy product developer can reach a global audience in their language and with their cultural expectations? How can we reduce developer friction in our localisation deployment processes? With your expertise, we will develop libraries and systems used by hundreds of Etsy engineers, and further improve our existing systems. We've written about some of our work, such as our address and currency formatting libraries. This is a full-time role located in our Dublin office (not a remote position). About the Role Contribute at all levels of our web application stack, ranging from front-end web interfaces (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React) to back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL, BigQuery). We do not expect you to have complete expertise of our stack before you join us; we all learn on the job. Provide detailed and constructive design and code reviews. Work cross-functionally with various engineering teams. Gain insights through research, data analysis, and our A/B tests. Push code to production early and often using our continuous deployment systems. Continuously learn from your teammates and share your own insights with them. Empathy, communication, and technical skill are valued equally. About You You have experience working on a large scale, high performance and fault-tolerant systems. You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify. You care as much about building phenomenal products as you do writing great code. You have a “leave it better than you found it” mentality, and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write. Have a knack for organization and breaking down large problems into smaller ones. Can be autonomous and a fast learner. You are a mindful, transparent, and communicative member of your team. Can spin yarns about how you've done this right and wrong at your previous job(s). And we'll give bonus points if you can actually spin yarn. Enjoy learning about and interacting with the people who use your product. What's Next  If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you've hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don't want you to be like everyone else - we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you're all about.  Our Promise  At Etsy, we believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us a more relevant, more competitive, and more resilient company. We encourage people from all backgrounds, ages, abilities, and experiences to apply. Etsy is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital or family status, disability, gender, gender identity or expression, pregnancy or caregiver status, veteran status, or any other legally protected status. We will ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to participate in the job application and interview process, to perform essential job functions, and to receive other benefits and privileges of employment.
