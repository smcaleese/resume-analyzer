At Workday, we help the world’s largest organizations adapt to what’s next by bringing finance, HR, and planning into a single enterprise cloud. We work hard, and we’re serious about what we do. But we like to have fun, too. We put people first, celebrate diversity, drive innovation, and do good in the communities where we live and work.   About the Team   About the Role   The Workday internal tooling team is responsible for building out a new evaluation runtime, compiler, language and IDE for our internal application development teams.   The technical underpinnings  A new way of evaluating our language at runtime gives us some opportunities for optimizations (faster execution using less memory), but the big wins come from being able to inspect the program that runs in a given transaction ahead of time, and re-code it in an optimized way. So, alongside the effort to implement a new runtime evaluator, we’ll see about implementing an evaluator that produces output code. Whether it is java bytecode (.class files) or a different representation, it can be something that runs better with all those nice look-ahead optimizations.   A new developer experience  If we are now compiling our code into something that runs better, we could imagine a different representation of our language that could also be compiled into that “something that runs better” above. There is little point to this if the different language does not improve on the existing language in significant ways. This new language is targeting keeping all the benefits of our existing language, but introducing new capabilities and an improved developer experience leading to more productive and happier developers.   About the Role  Lead multiple teams of dynamic software developers to build and maintain the application platform that supports application development in SaaS environment. Provide overall direction and guidance to the team.  Provide coaching, mentoring and support to the direct report staff in both technical and non-technical issues. Ensure high productivity of the team members. Provide support for their career growth and personal development.  Plan releases and schedule development. Provide estimates and initial assessment for proposed development tasks. Track and report progress of the project against key milestones. Balance resources with task assignments. Ensure on-time and high quality delivery of the project.  Keep feature stakeholders updated throughout the development cycle. Provide liaison with relevant parties, including product management, QA, other development teams, production, product support, etc., to facilitate the release process. Manage development related customer escalation when needed.  Contribute to process improvement within development organization. Institute and adopt best engineering practices.   About You   Basic Qualifications   5+ years’ experience in commercial enterprise software development.  3+ years OO software design and development experience.  3+ years’ experience in leading a software development team.   Other Qualifications  Passionate about software development and building strong engineering team. Ability to motivate and inspire the team.  Strong organizational skills. Experience in planning and execution of software development project. Exposure to agile development methodologies.  Strong verbal and written communication skills.  Strong ability to mentor developers. Good at recruiting and team building.  BS in Computer Science or related fields.  Strong technical knowledge in software development. Knowledge in Object Oriented run-time system and metadata driven declarative development environment is a strong plus.  Experience in enterprise software development environment is a plus.  Experience in fast paced startup environment is a plus.   Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!"

Phorest Salon Software powers over 8,000 hair and beauty salons in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Finland, the USA and Canada and the platform processes 7 million appointments a month for hair and beauty consumers.  Our system touches every point of the salon experience - from the in-salon software appointment calendar and CRM with a fully integrated marketing suite, to staff apps to payments. We are also the window through which the salon provides their end customer with an amazing experience through custom native apps, eCommerce and online bookings. Why? Because we want to help salons find their dream clients and get them back more often and spending more.   Phorest is the number 1 salon software brand for premium independent salons in those markets and one of our next goals is to allow our customers to easily receive payment from their clients using our software.   Over the last 18 months we have taken significant steps to integrate our product into the payments space. Our goal is to ensure Phorest can facilitate any type of financial transaction that occurs between our salons and their end customers. This is a technically complex and challenging domain, and one which has a huge potential impact for the future of the company. We’re really only just getting started, and we have lots of exciting ideas around payments that we want to bring to our product.   You will be a key member of a multidisciplinary team, designing and building the future of our multi-tenant SAAS platform. You will join a small group of highly skilled engineers in building exciting new features and extending our platform. Given we are a small product group, you will have freedom and control to shape our product vision without bureaucracy or politics.   You will be working on a large distributed system (event-driven and restful services running on Docker and Serverless) solving complex problems in an environment where we look to continuously improve and learn. We work with feature flags and continuous delivery to ensure our work gets to production as fast and safely as possible.  You will work with other engineers, product owners and designers to turn customer problems into features which solve those problems.  You will get to own the entire lifecycle of a feature. This includes activities such as producing technical design docs, writing and shipping code, planning the rollout to customers and being responsible for that feature in production.  You will spend the majority of your time on technical work, delivering clean, testable code, and will be continually looking to learn from both company and industry engineering best practices.  You will provide support to other engineers on your team, via activities such as pair programming, code reviews, and generally doing what you can to remove any blockers.  You will be working with a team of experienced engineers who will provide mentorship to you in order to help you grow and learn.  You will have the opportunity to shape how we solve technical problems, contributing to key architectural decisions within our product.  You will gain exposure to the payments industry, including integrating with the leading payment processing platforms in the tech space.  Strong proficiency and at least 3 years of professional experience with object-oriented software design - (for example Java, Kotlin, Ruby)  Discipline and appreciation of working with TDD / CI processes.  Experience designing distributed services which can communicate in a fault-tolerant manner using both RESTful and message-driven APIs.  Someone who wants to own their work from start to finish. We don’t have an operations team and engineers are expected to deploy and monitor the areas of the system they work in.  Familiarity with common software design patterns.  Experience within the domain of payments would be beneficial but not mandatory.  Experience with, or willingness to learn how to operate our AWS based infrastructure and services.  Experience working with relational and NoSQL databases and performance tuning.  Experience working in an agile, product led environment.  Ability to inspire and motivate, to improve quality and productivity, maintaining technical innovation and excellence.  Someone that challenges the norm and isn’t afraid to voice their opinion.  Your wellbeing is important to us - we provide private healthcare, an employee assistance program and a free online GP service (WebDoc).  As part of our Financial Wellbeing, we provide competitive Compensation, an Employee Share Purchase Scheme, Pension, Life Assurance, and Income Protection.

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting.

c9794a17fa6ec8b8,Arista Networks,Software Engineer,"Dublin, County Dublin"," Arista Networks is the leader in software driven networking solutions for today’s largest Data Center (DC), Cloud, Internet/WAN, Service Provider (SP) and Campus environments. Arista has over 7500 customers ranging from the largest cloud providers, to healthcare, government, carrier, finance, education, and production web/SaaS companies. Arista's products are the foundation underpinning much of modern society's operations.  Arista has ambitious plans and an unprecedented opportunity for growth and we are looking for many more engineers and designers to join us in building and innovating the world's networks. Arista is a profitable, publicly quoted company with revenues of over $2B with a culture of invention, quality, respect, and fun.  One of the many attractions of joining Arista is that right from the top, Arista is an engineering company. The founders and engineering managers are all engineers who understand good software engineering and the importance of doing things right.  Our management structure is flat and lightweight. Software engineering is run by software engineers who are in charge of delivering features from concept through to completion. We put a premium on building quality software and using automated testing. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work in many different areas over time.  Arista today is one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry. Arista has disrupted the market with two significant innovations:  Arista’s engineering team started from a blank sheet of paper to architect an entirely new networking operating system. Arista’s unique architecture is based on three guiding principles:  1) State Orientation for publish-subscribe communication  State Orientation uses a unique multi-process state-sharing architecture that separates state information from protocol processing and application logic with a central database shared by diverse applications. Both system state and data are stored in the system database where data is accessed via an automated publish/subscribe model. This distinct design principle provides module independence, self-healing resiliency, and multi-process software stability. It is an elegant distributed systems solution applied holistically right across the network.  This contrasts with the decades-old legacy approach of many competitors that uses extensive inter-process communications (IPC), a shared memory bus, or a complex message passing framework to communicate across the system components.  2) An Open Approach  Arista took to heart the lessons of the open-source world and built EOS on top of an unmodified Linux kernel, maintaining full, secured access to the Linux shell and utilities. It is notable that it is the same Linux OS that Arista’s customers run in their data centers and on their servers. This foundational methodology enables EOS to preserve the security, feature development, and tools of the Linux community, unlike legacy approaches where the original OS kernel is either modified or based on older, less maintained versions. By adhering to open source Linux, EOS also natively supports Linux containers and virtual machines, simplifying the deployment of new services and enhancing DevOps practices.  3) A Single Image  Arista’s third and crucial guiding principle is to provide a single software image that runs across all products in various packaging forms - physical platforms, virtual machines, and containers. The EOS single image uses the same source code, and the same version of the software released across the entire portfolio of switches and routers, thus improving network testing and reliability while reducing the complexity and cost of network operations.  This approach is a large differentiator to legacy vendors who use multiple operating systems with numerous images to implement a siloed network. Managing these multiple software images with quality control testing or new features testing multiplies operational costs. In contrast, when Arista releases a new software version, customers merely deploy a single image network-wide.  In addition, having a single image improves automation workflows by allowing DevOps tools, such as Ansible or Terraform, to work across all Arista devices with a single integration. Using these integrations, operators can establish Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines that build, test, and deploy network configurations across the entire data center with increased speed and reliability.  Your core responsibility is to deliver product features. A major part of this is writing the code that drives our products. But the role of a software engineer is much bigger than just being a programmer. Software engineers work on the whole development process, including:  Along the way, you might:  The Person:  If you...  ... then this job is for you.   A background in Linux, C++, TCP/IP, python, hardware, drivers, compilers, or assembly language is a plus. A Computer Science or Computer Engineering degree is desired.

You are eager to learn from the team as well as inspire your teammates with your knowledge and skills.  Who? What? Why?  Today, Twilio powers the delivery of billions of the world's communications. Customer conversations are one of the most informative indicators of a product and business' health. They cover every time a customer was delighted, frustrated, buying more, closing their account, needing help, etc. But usually those conversations are trapped away in a black box, analyzed only by listening to them one by one, or with basic keyword search capabilities.  The Twilio AI team is building a platform that uses machine learning to transcribe, categorise, and extract meaning out of customer conversations so companies can evaluate every one of them and build workflows that automate actions, like prioritizing high value leads to follow up on or identifying customers likely to churn. Our goal is to help companies power more effective business processes and better customer engagement, by understanding the meaning in every conversation.  Twilio is a company that is empowering the world's developers with modern communication in order to build better applications. Twilio is truly unique; we are a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development, and your entire employee experience.

We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.  About Us  Millions of developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience. Twilio has democratized communications channels like voice, text, chat, video and email by virtualizing the world's communications infrastructure through APIs that are simple enough for any developer to use, yet robust enough to power the world's most demanding applications.

And we further spice that with Private Edition, where customers bring Genesys Multicloud to their own data centers or preferred clouds? We succeed when we adopt top notch practices and use or develop technologies that are flexible and yet robust. If that sounds like you, you may want to join the Genesys Multicloud SRE team!  Background of Multicloud SRE Pipeline engineering team Genesys Multicloud is in hypergrowth. Our customers are large, complex and successful businesses across multiple industries, who have the most sophisticated requirements for their Customer Engagement systems. To deliver services that match the Genesys Multicloud reputation, we are seeking the most talented software engineers to build the best services available on the market. Our leaders recognize that spanning services over multiple clouds, while running efficiently is a challenge and therefore this gets attention and support. Genesys invests heavily in Multicloud SRE. This is the right time to join the Genesys Multicloud team as a talented person who strives to change things for the best! There are always opportunities to make improvements in our systems and processes! We have hundreds of repos in our GitHub org, and most of them include deployment workflows mostly based on terraform and helm. We have some fragmented pieces of code here and there and need to apply standards and best practices to these. We are constantly improving the way we manage secrets, auditing deployment events and ensuring compliance. What is simple to change in one workflow becomes more complicated at scale, since no workflows are exactly the same. Our team owns and maintains several in-house GitHub actions and internal services too, so we have some application code to develop as well.  What you need to be successful in this role: Good portfolio of tools or systems you developed or contributed to, written in languages such as NodeJS, TypeScript, python, golang or similar is what we are looking for. A solid hands-on experience with any public cloud (GCP experience gives you extra credit!) would be a bonus. You need to understand the basic priciples and challenges in delivering a CI/CD pipeline. We use github actions, so being able to put together a repo empowered with a workflow that can do some stuff will be a strong claim. You need to know how to collaborate with developers! Being helpful and persuasive and understanding the goals off a service engineer are key competencies for a good SRE engineer. If you can make a developer and an infrastructure engineer agree to changes you suggest; convince them to change their beloved code, ensure it gets to production and enjoy seeing observability metrics improve – we need you!  What you will do:   Benefits: #LI-VL1   Safety for our employees and our communities is a key priority for Genesys.

029fb59cfc79a732,Arista Networks,Backend Software Engineer - CloudVision,"Dublin, County Dublin"," Arista Networks is the leader in software driven networking solutions for today’s largest Data Center (DC), Cloud, Internet/WAN, Service Provider (SP) and Campus environments. Arista has over 7500 customers ranging from the largest cloud providers, to healthcare, government, carrier, finance, education, and production web/SaaS companies. Arista's products are the foundation underpinning much of modern society's operations.  Arista has ambitious plans and an unprecedented opportunity for growth and we are looking for many more engineers and designers to join us in building and innovating the world's networks. Arista is a profitable, publicly quoted company with revenues of over $2B with a culture of invention, quality, respect, and fun.  One of the many attractions of joining Arista is that right from the top, Arista is an engineering company. The founders and engineering managers are all engineers who understand good software engineering and the importance of doing things right.  Our management structure is flat and lightweight. Software engineering is run by software engineers who are in charge of delivering features from concept through to completion. We put a premium on building quality software and using automated testing. No part of the company is off-limits, meaning that our engineers have the chance to work in many different areas over time.  Arista today is one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry. Arista has disrupted the market with two significant innovations:  Arista’s engineering team started from a blank sheet of paper to architect an entirely new networking operating system. Arista’s unique architecture is based on three guiding principles:  1) State Orientation for publish-subscribe communication  State Orientation uses a unique multi-process state-sharing architecture that separates state information from protocol processing and application logic with a central database shared by diverse applications. Both system state and data are stored in the system database where data is accessed via an automated publish/subscribe model. This distinct design principle provides module independence, self-healing resiliency, and multi-process software stability. It is an elegant distributed systems solution applied holistically right across the network.  This contrasts with the decades-old legacy approach of many competitors that uses extensive inter-process communications (IPC), a shared memory bus, or a complex message passing framework to communicate across the system components.  2) An Open Approach  Arista took to heart the lessons of the open-source world and built EOS on top of an unmodified Linux kernel, maintaining full, secured access to the Linux shell and utilities. It is notable that it is the same Linux OS that Arista’s customers run in their data centers and on their servers. This foundational methodology enables EOS to preserve the security, feature development, and tools of the Linux community, unlike legacy approaches where the original OS kernel is either modified or based on older, less maintained versions. By adhering to open source Linux, EOS also natively supports Linux containers and virtual machines, simplifying the deployment of new services and enhancing DevOps practices.  3) A Single Image  Arista’s third and crucial guiding principle is to provide a single software image that runs across all products in various packaging forms - physical platforms, virtual machines, and containers. The EOS single image uses the same source code, and the same version of the software released across the entire portfolio of switches and routers, thus improving network testing and reliability while reducing the complexity and cost of network operations.  This approach is a large differentiator to legacy vendors who use multiple operating systems with numerous images to implement a siloed network. Managing these multiple software images with quality control testing or new features testing multiplies operational costs. In contrast, when Arista releases a new software version, customers merely deploy a single image network-wide.  In addition, having a single image improves automation workflows by allowing DevOps tools, such as Ansible or Terraform, to work across all Arista devices with a single integration. Using these integrations, operators can establish Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines that build, test, and deploy network configurations across the entire data center with increased speed and reliability.  CloudVision is Arista’s enterprise network management and streaming telemetry SaaS offering, serving the world’s largest Financials, Media and Entertainment, Health Care, and Cloud companies. As we continue to scale the service and expand into new markets, we’re looking to grow the team with experienced Software Engineers anchored by our Dublin and Kraków offices.  CloudVision’s core infrastructure is a scale-out distributed system providing real-time and historical access to the full network state, along with frameworks for building advanced analytics. It’s written in go and leverages open source technologies like HBase, ClickHouse, ElasticSearch, and Kafka under the covers. We’re constantly investing in scaling out the platform and building out richer analytics capabilities in the infrastructure.  On top of this core platform we are building network management and analytics applications to fully automate today’s enterprise network, from CI/CD pipelines for network automation, to advanced analytics and remediation for network assurance.  As a Backend Software Engineer at Arista, you own your project end to end. You and your project team will work with product management and customers to define the requirements and design the architecture. You’ll build the backend, write automated tests, and get it deployed into production via our CD pipeline.

cded0c3e1ab4f9f4,Phorest,Software Engineer - Phorest Pay - Remote (to GMT +2) /...,"Dublin, County Dublin","  Would you like to help to create the future of a product used by thousands of businesses and millions of consumers? Phorest Salon Software powers over 8,000 hair and beauty salons in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Finland, the USA and Canada and the platform processes 7 million appointments a month for hair and beauty consumers.  Our system touches every point of the salon experience - from the in-salon software appointment calendar and CRM with a fully integrated marketing suite, to staff apps to payments. We are also the window through which the salon provides their end customer with an amazing experience through custom native apps, eCommerce and online bookings. Why? Because we want to help salons find their dream clients and get them back more often and spending more.   Phorest is the number 1 salon software brand for premium independent salons in those markets and one of our next goals is to allow our customers to easily receive payment from their clients using our software.   Over the last 18 months we have taken significant steps to integrate our product into the payments space. Our goal is to ensure Phorest can facilitate any type of financial transaction that occurs between our salons and their end customers. This is a technically complex and challenging domain, and one which has a huge potential impact for the future of the company. We’re really only just getting started, and we have lots of exciting ideas around payments that we want to bring to our product.   You will be a key member of a multidisciplinary team, designing and building the future of our multi-tenant SAAS platform. You will join a small group of highly skilled engineers in building exciting new features and extending our platform. Given we are a small product group, you will have freedom and control to shape our product vision without bureaucracy or politics.   You will be working on a large distributed system (event-driven and restful services running on Docker and Serverless) solving complex problems in an environment where we look to continuously improve and learn. We work with feature flags and continuous delivery to ensure our work gets to production as fast and safely as possible.  You will work with other engineers, product owners and designers to turn customer problems into features which solve those problems.  You will get to own the entire lifecycle of a feature. This includes activities such as producing technical design docs, writing and shipping code, planning the rollout to customers and being responsible for that feature in production.  You will spend the majority of your time on technical work, delivering clean, testable code, and will be continually looking to learn from both company and industry engineering best practices.  You will provide support to other engineers on your team, via activities such as pair programming, code reviews, and generally doing what you can to remove any blockers.  You will be working with a team of experienced engineers who will provide mentorship to you in order to help you grow and learn.  You will have the opportunity to shape how we solve technical problems, contributing to key architectural decisions within our product.  You will gain exposure to the payments industry, including integrating with the leading payment processing platforms in the tech space.  Strong proficiency and at least 3 years of professional experience with object-oriented software design - (for example Java, Kotlin, Ruby)  Discipline and appreciation of working with TDD / CI processes.  Experience designing distributed services which can communicate in a fault-tolerant manner using both RESTful and message-driven APIs.  Someone who wants to own their work from start to finish. We don’t have an operations team and engineers are expected to deploy and monitor the areas of the system they work in.  Familiarity with common software design patterns.  Experience within the domain of payments would be beneficial but not mandatory.  Experience with, or willingness to learn how to operate our AWS based infrastructure and services.  Experience working with relational and NoSQL databases and performance tuning.  Experience working in an agile, product led environment.  Ability to inspire and motivate, to improve quality and productivity, maintaining technical innovation and excellence.  Someone that challenges the norm and isn’t afraid to voice their opinion.  Your wellbeing is important to us - we provide private healthcare, an employee assistance program and a free online GP service (WebDoc).  As part of our Financial Wellbeing, we provide competitive Compensation, an Employee Share Purchase Scheme, Pension, Life Assurance, and Income Protection.  We help you travel by providing a bike to work scheme as well as tax saver transport tickets.  We care for your family and provide Enhanced Maternity and Paternity benefits.  We grow our own timber!

Since 2013 we’ve been building a company and product that our customers—and their customers—love, and importantly laying the foundations of a solid, sustainable business for ourselves in the years to come.  We are committed to providing delightful experiences to our customers, based on strong ethical values and a commitment to excellence. We are also proudly independent giving us full control of our strategy and direction, allowing us to set our own course.  We recognise the huge potential for growth in Vito and while we’ve traditionally followed a slow and steady mantra, given that our existing business has been wiped out by the Coronavirus crisis, we recognise the need to do things a little differently.  For more background, see our About page.  Founded by Paul and Doc, Team Tito comprises six full-time staff, with the team focussed mostly on customer operations and product operations, with contractors filling the other core responsibilities.  We are a remote-first company. Three team members are currently located abroad, with the remainder based at Tito HQ in Dublin, but all company interactions are led as though everyone were remote, even if we share an office.   We’re looking for someone to help us build amazing, modern user interfaces that are responsive, great to use, and fun to maintain.

We have Dockerized everything, which means that as a frontend dev, you just need to (almost) `docker-compose up` and you'll get a near-production replica of our apps running locally, allowing you to test all sorts of real-world cases right on your own machine.

Etsy is seeking a Staff Software Engineer, II to join our International Experience team. We’re a multi-functional group of engineering, product management, design, research, and analytics.  Our team has two primary responsibilities. First, ensuring that key product development infrastructure is properly localised such as our internal taxonomy, locale management, formatting libraries, etc. Second, that all products & marketing tools are integrated into our human translation systems, ensuring that Etsy fluently speaks to every buyer and seller in their chosen language.  Here’s a taste of the problems we’re solving:  How can we ensure that every Etsy product developer can reach a global audience in their language and with their cultural expectations?

You have experience working on a large scale, high performance and fault-tolerant systems.  You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify.  You care as much about building phenomenal products as you do enabling engineers to write great code.  You have a “leave it better than you found it” mentality and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write.

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.
