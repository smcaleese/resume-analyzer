The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a new capability in Windows that opens up new possibilities for Linux development and operations in Windows environments. WSL is not a virtual machine system like Hyper-V, nor an operations capability like Docker or Kubernetes, nor a cloud simulator like Multipass. Instead, WSL offers a specific set of capabilities from a Linux environment across to the Windows desktop, allowing for interesting new kinds of integration to take place at that boundary. Use your Windows editors and version control, compile and test on Linux, for example. 
We are excited to explore the forefront of these possibilities, helping to shape the future of Windows-and-Linux development. We work closely with the WSL team to ensure that the latest capabilities in WSL are usable and well integrated with Ubuntu. We work with other developer communities, such as those at Nvidia, to ensure that the cross-over of their needs and the Windows platform takes advantage of WSL. 
Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are help individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu. 
You will be responsible for delivering the best Linux experience on WSL to a huge audience. You will have direct influence over the roadmap for Ubuntu on WSL and will specify, architect and develop features in association with other leaders such as tech leads, engineering managers, product managers and developer advocates. 
You will have the opportunity to speak at conferences about your work on WSL, and interact with a very enthusiastic community. 
The successful candidate will be passionate about the future of Ubuntu, mindful of the dynamics of the open source ecosystem, and equally aware of the needs of large organisations. Strong communication and relationship skills are as important as superb technical skills. This job involves international travel several times a year, usually for one week at a time. Canonical believes a diverse workforce enhances our ability to deliver world class software and services which meet the world's computing needs. We are committed to ensuring equal employment opportunities to all qualified individuals. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Etsy, Inc.'s 'house of brands' portfolio has expanded to now include four individually distinct ecommerce brands – Etsy, fashion resale marketplace Depop, musical instrument marketplace Reverb, and Brazil-based handmade goods marketplace Elo7. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact. 
About the Team 
Etsy is seeking a Senior Software Engineer to join our International Experience team. We’re a multi-functional group of engineering, product management, design, research, and analytics. 
Our team has two primary responsibilities. First, ensuring that key product development infrastructure is properly localised such as our internal taxonomy, locale management, formatting libraries, etc. Second, that all products & marketing tools are integrated into our human translation systems, ensuring that Etsy fluently speaks to every buyer and seller in their chosen language. 
Here’s a taste of the problems we’re solving: 
How can we ensure that every Etsy product developer can reach a global audience in their language and with their cultural expectations? 
How can we reduce developer friction in our localisation deployment processes? 
With your expertise, we will develop libraries and systems used by hundreds of Etsy engineers, and further improve our existing systems. We've written about some of our work, such as our address and currency formatting libraries. 
This is a full-time role located in our Dublin office (not a remote position). 
About the Role 
Contribute at all levels of our web application stack, ranging from front-end web interfaces (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React) to back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL, BigQuery). We do not expect you to have complete expertise of our stack before you join us; we all learn on the job. 
Provide detailed and constructive design and code reviews. 
Work cross-functionally with various engineering teams. 
Gain insights through research, data analysis, and our A/B tests. 
Push code to production early and often using our continuous deployment systems. 
Continuously learn from your teammates and share your own insights with them. 
Empathy, communication, and technical skill are valued equally.  
About You 
You have experience working on a large scale, high performance and fault-tolerant systems. 
You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify. 
You care as much about building phenomenal products as you do writing great code. 
You have a “leave it better than you found it” mentality, and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write. 
Have a knack for organization and breaking down large problems into smaller ones. 
Can be autonomous and a fast learner. 
You are a mindful, transparent, and communicative member of your team. 
Can spin yarns about how you've done this right and wrong at your previous job(s). And we'll give bonus points if you can actually spin yarn. 
Enjoy learning about and interacting with the people who use your product. 
What's Next

If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you've hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don't want you to be like everyone else - we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you're all about.

Our Promise

At Etsy, we believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us a more relevant, more competitive, and more resilient company.

6a8f6380eca76dfb,Square,"Software Engineer, Risk Engineering","Dublin, County Dublin","Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.


There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same. 
Risk Engineering works to protect Square and our customers from fraud and payment disputes. We keep our customers safe while €20B+ flows through Square annually, and we allow the entire company to take risks and grow. To do this, we build systems to detect and respond to potential fraud threats, provide outstanding tools to agents for investigating fraud events, and give our customers seamless web and mobile experiences to manage and fight payment disputes. Our mission is to protect Square, protect our customers, and make a complicated and sometimes painful process understandable to all. 
This is an exciting time for Square as we have recently launched within the Irish market as part of our plans to continue growing our merchant network globally. We're now looking for multiple full-stack and backend engineers to join our new Risk team in Dublin, Ireland. You 'd be among the first engineers joining us in Dublin, establishing a team that is committed to keeping our customers safe from fraud and mitigating the impact of financial loss. You'd work with other engineering teams, and our Risk Operations and Policy team here in Dublin, and you'd work on a global scale to strategize on and provide the product roadmap. As part of this growth we need to ensure that our protection scales to meet this new demand.

Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes. 
This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers. 
Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation. 
Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu. 
We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

To achieve scale, you will be working on a complex distributed, multi-tier platform using technologies such as Kafka, OpenAPI/Swagger and other open source Java libraries. At times, you will need to build things from scratch, but more often than not, it will be extending and enhancing existing art.

We celebrate our wins and learn from our failures, big and small.

 Being innovative while delivering fast can only be achieved if focus is kept on building the things that matter most. We succeed as a team by operating in short release cycles, aggressively prioritizing, applying agile methodologies, incorporating continuous feedback and employing data driven decisions.
 We seek individuals who are curious, have a passion for learning, enjoy problem solving and thrive on delivering with your team. Above all, we expect our engineers to figure out what should be done and get it done within the spirit of Salesforce - this requires thoughtfulness with a bias towards taking action and assuming responsibility.
  Main responsibilities
 Collaborate with Product Managers, Architects, and Engineering leaders to define, architect and implement various Omni features from the UI all the way to the database.
 Drive quality by test case authoring, writing unit, functional, and integration tests automation, including negative and disruptive testing. We are a hybrid team, and quality assurance is not a separate responsibility.
 Practice Service Ownership of our functionality to ensure 24*7 availability by actively participating in production support, release and on-call duties.
