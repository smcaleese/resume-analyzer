At Personio we are on the amazing journey of exponential customer and product growth. After our recent $125M Series D funding we are the most valuable HR tech company in Europe and we are investing heavily in our Technology Platform.




The mission of the Technology Platform tribe is to ensure Personio is built and operated with excellence. We are responsible for ensuring our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and ensuring our engineers have the tools and infrastructure to achieve this. We measure engineering excellence through core metrics of software development delivery. We use these metrics to drive initiatives that enable our peer engineering teams to build, test, deploy, monitor and operate Personio to the highest industry standards.




In the Developer Experience (DX) team, we enable our own developers to build, test and deploy code quickly, easily and reliably on their own. We focus on maximizing engineering effectiveness, by developing and distributing robust and practical development tools, building scalable devops processes, and advocating for software development best practices.

The DX Engineer is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organisation. We support our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, and we play a key role in enabling them to deprecate our monolith and create a highly scalable microservices architecture with modern tech stacks.




Do you get excited about developer tools, build pipelines, continuous delivery and deploying, running and monitoring highly scalable applications on Kubernetes? Are you interested in guiding, helping and sharing knowledge with fellow developers? Are you eager to solve the challenges that engineers face to improve the entire department’s productivity and provide a delightful developer experience? Then this role is for you!




Responsibilities

You will research, engineer and experiment with new ways to improve developer workflows and devops practices to reduce our Lead Time to Production and increase Deployment Frequency
You will maintain and improve Personio’s dev environments and build infrastructure. Your scope will include everything from how services are developed and tested locally, to how they are built and integration-tested using our Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, to how they are rolled out, run and monitored in our production Kubernetes cluster.
You will foster relationships and work closely with product teams to support them in the migration of our monolith to microservices architecture, understand their challenges and propose result-oriented solutions to improve their productivity.
You will pair with other engineers on the DX team and take ownership on delivering new innovation solutions.




What you need to succeed

Between 3-5 years of software engineering experience building and designing scalable applications, tools or distributed systems. You understand the needs of software engineers working in product teams, you’ve been in their shoes, and can empathise with them. You want to help your fellow engineers to achieve maximum efficiency.
You have experience with at least one of our tech stacks: Java/Kotlin (JVM, Gradle, SpringBoot), PHP (Laravel), Golang, Python or TypeScript. In particular you’re comfortable with the intricacies of their build ecosystems (build tools, tasks runners, etc.) and you understand how to monitor and manage them in a containerised production environment.
You’ve had exposure to and an interest in DevOps tools and technologies such as: Kubernetes, AWS, Sentry, DataDog, Docker, Git/Gitlab, Flagger, and Linkerd, as well as deployment automation (CI/CD pipelines, blue/green and canary deployments).
You’re comfortable writing, documenting and distributing robust and delightful scripts, CLI tools and plugins for developers.




You’re interested in development processes and practices (merge requests, approvals, trunk-based vs branch-based development, etc), and are eager to optimise them.
You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services, and understand the value of increasing your impact through great technical documentation, knowledge shares and tutorials.
You love data driven decision making and the metrics of Developer Experience - Lead Time and Deployment Frequency.
You have an excellent written and spoken English (level C1/C2 on the CEFR scale)
We are experiencing rapid growth and are “building our plane while flying it” so bring your agile mindset to the table!

About The Team

As we grow the Peakon engineering team at Workday, we are looking for an experienced Backend Engineer to join one of your product teams based in Dublin. Peakon teams own their roadmap, work collaboratively and include engineering, UI/UX design, and product management.

The Peakon team at Workday is driven by the belief that we can radically change the world of work. We believe that when an organisation listens to employee feedback and empowers every employee to drive the change they want to see, it can create more fulfilling jobs and grow in ways never before imagined.

We’re in the business of creating great places to work, so it should be no surprise that being a great place to work is our highest priority. With ambitions as big as ours, we see individual growth and development as the key strategy for growing our business.

About The Role

Your focus will be to contribute to the development, architecture, and evolution of the Peakon platform.

You will be a key contributor in technical and architectural discussions within the backend engineering team, working closely with peers and engineering leaders to drive the technical direction of our platform forward.

Contribute to architectural discussions with other engineers across all levels
Use your technical expertise to contribute towards building a best-in-class product


Our tech

We make it a priority to stay on the cutting edge of tech. We are highly motivated by learning and growing in our roles, and constantly evolving is a key part of that.

We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain, which is why our tech stack centres around JavaScript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with a growing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.

We rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base.

We use Buildkite for continuous integration to make sure our most recent changes are always available to test, and we deploy code to our production environment every day.

About You

Basic Qualifications

3+ years of experience with backend development
You have worked in a team setting, using collaborative tools for version control, code reviews and project management


Other Qualifications

You are familiar with a Node.js based ecosystem or willing to put in the extra work at the beginning to make the switch
You have experience building web applications with an understanding of scalability, high availability, latency and throughput
You are open to opinions of others and constructively discuss solutions to find the best one for the challenge at hand
You are able to quickly and accurately break down, estimate, prioritise, and deliver projects of high technical complexity
You have excellent verbal and written communication skills in English


We welcome your application even if you do not meet all of the criteria listed above, but are passionate about the opportunity of mastering this role.

If you like developing new solutions and turning big ideas into reality, ALVARIA is the place for you. At ALVARIA, you’ll work with smart and motivated people to make a difference for the companies we serve.

Own your work. You have demonstrated ability to take a problem all the way to implementation and take pride in what you do.  Your work personally reflects on you. You know it and produce high quality output as a result.

Collaborate. If you don’t like working with people or having your ideas debated openly, this job is not for you. You do not just tolerate having to walk through your code with someone else, you seek it out because you like to explain yourself and you like to learn from others

Communicate with excellence both orally and in written form with management, customers, and coworkers.  You take communicating clearly very seriously.

Take Initiative. You have a track record of not waiting on being told what to do, but rather seeking out how you can help and improve things you touch.  You do not allow yourself to be blocked; you find a way.

Learn. The ability to learn quickly is a highly valued skill here.  You need to have a proven ability to take in large amounts of not always well-structured information, internalize it and act on it in a timely fashion

Automate. Every engineer is expected to shepherd a feature or sometimes a system through to the end. You are a zealot about automated testing around your code (unit, integration, functional); you will have employed other DevOps practices such as continuous integration, and continuous deployment or delivery

Test. You are someone who doesn’t write code without tests to prove it works, perhaps you are even a test-first type of person.  You have worked also with full integration or end-to-end automated test frameworks.

Be humble.  We’re not looking for self-described rock stars, rather engineers who are sharp and confident in their skills but also open to being wrong and willing to learn from others.

In this role we are looking for people with: 

 Fluency in Javascript, typescript & Node.JS
 Experience working within the AWS or Google Cloud Platform ecosystem
 Experience with Kafka & Redis
 Experienced with API design, building and consuming Micro Services
 Exposure to containerization & orchestration technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
 Experience building and operating cloud services and fault-tolerant distributed systems preferably on the AWS & Google Cloud Platform
 Familiarity with CI/CD tooling and methodologies
 Awareness of zero downtime upgrade concepts and strategies
 Experience working on multi-tenanted platforms
 Experience with system monitoring tools such as Datadog
 Excellent leadership, verbal, and written communication skills with the ability to work well in a team
 Interest in learning new technologies and continuously evolving and evaluating the tech stack.

Aspect is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer with a strong commitment to diversity. In that spirit, we are particularly interested in receiving applications from a broad spectrum of people, including women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, veterans or any other legally protected group.

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Taking ownership - The code we ship is our responsibility as we know it best;

Result-oriented - You manage the trade-offs between speed and quality and are able to find the right balance. You would rather ship, measure, learn and iterate, rather than coding the perfect component on the first try.
Resilient - You can adapt and roll up your sleeves to help others. You operate at a stable pace with visibility most of the time and you are ready to embrace change when it happens.
Communicative - You are able to communicate with your team, stakeholders, and other peers inside Engineering, being able to share ideas, bring different opinions and also give constructive feedback. You are able to translate your thoughts/ideas to technical and non-technical people.

We have physical offices in New York, Dublin, London, Paris and Hong Kong. Some of our team members work from home in other countries and cities. Occasional travel will be required for client meetings, and some projects may require being at the client’s location. On average this happens 20% of the time (obviously much less during COVID), but some projects may require more substantial on-site work with client teams.

To be employed in a country, you need to have an existing employment visa in that country and speak the local language fluently.

The Role 

We are building a development function to continuously improve, extend or replace the existing stack of applications and systems under the ownership of the Trading Tribe at PPB. Projects undertaken by this group will be many and varied and will mean that in joining this team you will gain exposure to a wide variety of applications, development approaches and technologies. We have an opportunity to look at our existing estate and to find ways to add value through optimising, automating, re-architecting and through the addition of new features and creation of new platforms where necessary.

We use Scala and Java where appropriate to build our platforms, and are focused on using the right technology for each task.

Is this you? 

You have spent years using agile and lean practices to deliver world class software. You are a Kaizen creature who never stops thinking about how to improve yourself and your team.

When hardware fails, your applications keep going because they are fault tolerant. When the company grows, your applications scale right alongside. Customers enjoy using your applications, because they are reactive and always perform well.

You understand that building the ‘right thing' is as important as building the ‘thing right', and have leveraged test-driven techniques such as ATDD to achieve both. You believe that software quality is the responsibility of the whole team, regardless of job titles.

You understand and embrace the philosophy of Continuous Delivery. You have no interest in throwing your work ‘over the wall' to anybody. Instead, you passionately believe in an agile, DevOps-centric team that builds, tests, releases and operates its own applications.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

Stripe’s backend engineers work on the business logic for all of that. As a backend engineer, you will build and expand APIs and services and work with our partners to launch new markets, payment methods, and capabilities.

We have backend engineers in almost every team across Stripe, and in that role, you’ll be making some of the most significant decisions for the company. You’ll get to work with other engineers to build delightful features that span various parts of the system, as well as our business, sales and operations teams to understand and solve our users’ pain points.

We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products or systems; you’re comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; you have exquisite attention to detail; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems.


Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams
Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes

Enjoy and have experience building APIs
Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.

It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.


Build a new API for our users, or iterate on existing APIs
Launch a new market or payment method
Work with our Analytics and Fraud teams to reduce chargebacks and declines
Build new tools for our business teams
Build new systems to securely store sensitive data

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

Beyond's Engineering team believes in:




Reducing scope - The best way to control progress and test hypotheses is to prevent scope creep;
Shipping early - The best way to learn early is to ship early. No need to be perfect;
Iterating and improving - Once we get the feedback we need, we iterate and improve;
Taking ownership - The code we ship is our responsibility as we know it best;

Result-oriented - You manage the trade-offs between speed and quality and are able to find the right balance. You would rather ship, measure, learn and iterate, rather than coding the perfect component on the first try.

Now that we've told you what the job looks like, here are the qualifications we're looking for in a candidate:

We trust each other, we engineer trust into our solutions, and we work hard every day to earn the trust of our clients and partners.

With solutions in Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security, we help improve customer and employee search experiences, keep critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats. Elastic enables organizations worldwide to use the power of Elastic, including Netflix, Uber, BBC, Microsoft, and thousands of others.

Elastic was built on a foundation of being free and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organization and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture.

The Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications.

The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, Logs, and Uptime solutions. When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, how do we store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, how do we present this information to the user, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market.

As a Java Agent Engineer on the APM team, you will be part of a team developing a high quality, open source APM product aimed to help fellow Java developers instrument, debug, and monitor Java applications. As part of the agent team, you’ll be deeply involved with the entire codebase and take on responsibilities for new features, improving the resource footprint and roadmap planning.

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

 Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B The company’s valuation has more than tripled since early 2020.
 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.
 According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.
 Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT.
 The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually
 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.
 Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip.
 The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

All this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!"

b50dbbe5846d4d63bf00dc7069c549c6,"Reddit, Inc.","Staff Backend Engineer, NFT Platform","Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland Remote","Our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. With more than 50 million people visiting 100,000+ communities daily, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. From pets to parenting, skincare to stocks, there’s a community for everybody on Reddit. For more information, visit redditinc.com.

In case you haven’t heard, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the newest, most explosive movement in the world of crypto. With the power of blockchain, it is now possible to truly own digital assets on the internet in a way that wasn’t possible before. Even though excitement over NFTs is only just beginning, sales have already hit $2.5B this year and it can be a bit difficult to explain why.

For many, it’s a way to support their favorite artists, and for others it’s a way to curate impressive collections of ultra-rare collectibles. Just as cryptocurrencies are set to revolutionize the world of economics and finance, NFTs are going to rewrite how we think about digital goods. So while NFTs are currently dominated by digital artwork, NFTs can be minted to represent ownership in any item at all. Beyond visual art, there are already NFTs for music, videos, articles, and even memes. Many believe that NFTs will become the standard for items in online games, as well as items in the eventual metaverse.

For Reddit, it will always be about community. As the “frontpage of the Internet”, Reddit brings over 430 million people together each month through their common interests, inviting them to share, vote, comment, and create across thousands of communities. If there is one thing we’ve noticed with NFTs, they too have an incredible power to create a sense of participation and belonging. With every new NFT project, a vibrant community of owners pops up with it. Fans of today’s biggest creators and brands are now flocking to buy digital goods directly from them -- to support them, to gain exclusive access, and to feel a greater sense of connection with them. Over time, we believe this will only grow, and NFTs will play a central role in how fans support their favorite creators and communities.

Our team is a new and exciting, rapidly growing team that aims to build the largest creator economy on the internet, powered by independent creators, digital goods, and NFTs. We are looking for strong engineers and leaders to help us seed the team, set its strategy, and build for the future. If you ask us, the NFT movement has only just begun, so come and join our team to get started.

Responsibilities

Design, build and ship backend services for millions of users to create, buy, sell and use NFT-backed digital goods.
Move fast while balancing quality. We can’t afford extensive processes, and we also can’t afford show-stopping bugs. We need people who can balance speed with quality while quickly building brand-new products.
Contribute meaningfully to team strategy. We give everyone a seat at the table and encourage active participation in planning for the future. Don’t just come along for the ride.
Communicate effectively, within the team and across disciplines. Work closely with product managers and designers to craft compelling user experiences.


5+ years backend development experience with multiple parts of the backend stack, from databases to networking to efficient computing. We develop with Go, Python, Postgres, Redis, Thrift, GraphQL and deploy to Docker/k8s on AWS.
Ability to design and implement complex distributed systems operating under high load. Experience developing customer-facing public applications is preferred.
Entrepreneurial spirit. On our team, everyone needs to act like a startup CEO. You must be self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You live to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.
Excellent communication skills. You must be able to collaborate effectively with teams in a fully-remote environment, and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences.
Experience with crypto / NFTs / Go is not required! All of us learned along the way, and so can you.

Learn. The ability to learn quickly is a highly-valued skill here. You need to have a proven ability to take in large amounts of not always well structured information, internalize it and act on it in a timely fashion

Automate. Every engineer is expected to shepherd a feature or sometimes a system through to the end. You are a zealot about automated testing around your code (unit, integration, functional); you will have employed other DevOps practices such as continuous integration, and continuous deployment or delivery

Test. You are someone who doesn’t write code without tests to prove it works, perhaps you are even a test-first type of person. You have worked also with full integration or end-to-end automated test frameworks.

Be humble.  We’re not looking for self-described rock stars, rather engineers who are sharp and confident in their skills but also open to being wrong and willing to learn from others.

IN THIS ROLE WE ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH:

Fluency in Java or Scala
Experienced with API design, building and consuming Micro Services
Exposure to containerization & orchestration technologies such as docker, kubernetes, helm
Exposure to infrastructure automation such as terraform or Ansible 
Strong linux/unix experience
Experience building and operating cloud services and fault-tolerant distributed systems preferably on the AWS platform
Familiarity with CI/CD tooling and methodologies
Awareness of zero downtime upgrade concepts and strategies
Experience working on multi-tenanted platforms
Experience with various system monitoring tools such as datadog, sumologic, splunk
Experience with distributed relational databases eg PostgreSQL, RDS
Excellent leadership, verbal and written communication skills with the ability to work well in a team
Interest in learning new technologies and continuously evolving and evaluating the tech stack.

About the role




The word “meeting” triggers visceral reactions in most people. We either have too many of them, or the meetings often seem superfluous. We do however strongly believe that meetings are one (if not the) most important activity a company does.

We’re on a quest to use design patterns and technology to redefine how meetings happen. Transposing in-office techniques to online meetings simply doesn’t work. As we see the hybrid workspace becoming more prevalent than ever, meetings and the digital meeting experience has to be redesigned from the ground up to ultimately bridge that gap between the office and remote working.

We are actively looking for an enthusiastic, responsible, self-driven and experienced full stack engineer to come and help us build key features of our platform including UX and frontend feature integrations, all the way to the required modifications of the backend REST APIs to support these new features.

The ideal candidate has worked remotely (as we are a fully remote company) and is interested in using technology to change how people attend and consume meeting information.

· Be a partner and a sounding board to our CPO and CTO to ensure the features are viable

· Work closely with the team to architect, implement, and rollout new features

· At least 4 years experience as a full stack engineer using Python, preferably having built APIs with FastAPI and Flask.

· Strong familiarity with React, Tailwind, webpack, etc.

· Experience with SQL, and familiarity with ORMs a plus

· Experience using Docker and Amazon AWS

· Knowledge of Postgres

· Experience working remotely and you enjoy and excel at it

· Deep empathy for remote work, meeting fatigue and information overload

· Able to positively convince, disagree constructively, and/or disagree and commit.




Salary & Perks




We want you to be well and thrive. Our global benefits package includes:




· €85,000.00-€100,000.00 per annum. If it’s too little, tell us what you have in mind

· Fully remote, work from anywhere

· 100% Healthcare coverage

· Stock option program

· Paid parental leave

· Open vacation policy

· Remote-work/Home-office upgrade & WFH allowance (country specific rules allowing)







Clearword is proud to be a remote-first company. We also understand life-work balance, we live it, and are all huge proponents of it.

Well for one, we love the movie ""The Goonies"", and so should you. On the other hand we like to think outside the polygon.

THE ROLE AND YOUR IMPACT AT TIER

As a Software Developer in Platform you will build the solid, foundational and event-driven micro-services that product teams and partners can rely and build their services on while TIER continues to grow with warp-speed.
We design it. We test it. We build it. We ship it. We document it. You own it all. The good, the bad, the ugly and the glory.
Geo is everything, and everything is geo. Try to imagine the amount of (geo) data that 150.000 vehicles produce every second. Then add even more vehicles to that, because we're bigger than that. If you think you have an idea, you're already lying to yourself about it. It's a lot. And it's exciting to work with that. Trust us.
You will coordinate projects with product teams, gather their requirements and implement features. But as a platform team we pride ourselves with ingenuity and openness towards new technologies that help us manage TIER scale. That said, discoveries will be a big part of the job, and it is highly encouraged to keep an open mind.
 YOU’LL FIT GREAT WITH THESE SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

Ideally, you have 2+ years experience in Nodejs/TypeScript (or any other strongly typed language)
You have first hand experience or you’re interested in building event-driven systems with Apache Kafka
Since we're the geo team, any experience and previous touchpoints with the geospatial world is a huge plus
You understand the importance of building services that scale
We do trunk-based development. You own your code and bring it all the way to production.
Experience with kubernetes and terraform is a plus, but don't you worry as we have an excellent infrastructure teams that rush to your aid if need be.

Our development culture and values?

When you want to apply, you probably have loads of questions. Let us try to answer some already. Below we summarized our development culture and how our values translate into daily practices.

START-TO-FINISH OWNERSHIP

Our product delivery teams accept a high level of autonomy. You take ownership and show the ability to decide and act for the good of the product.

FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS

Remote work is possible but face to face collaboration is encouraged.
If possible, we do try to work together, at least 1 day a week. Great for some face to face bonding with your colleagues.
You can start whenever you want. We have a short stand up meeting (remote) at 10 am, but if we need to rearrange we can discuss it with the team.

LIGHT MEETINGS

We prevent meetings from overwhelming an engineer’s schedule and protect your ‘maker time’ as much as possible. We only do a short status update every morning at 10 am.
Twice a week the engineering team has a coffee talk in which the participants rant freely or discuss interesting things that they have found
Every 6 weeks we do a company-wide half-day meeting to learn from our colleagues (customer success managers, support, sales, marketing, …). These meetings are intended to learn, but also to socialize with colleagues and understand how we impact our customers.

PRODUCT-DRIVEN

The product managers are closely involved with the development team.
You’ll always have a clear view of the direction the product is going and why.
Priorities can change but are always discussed together. New things coming in the sprint means other stuff is going out.

WORK/LIFE BALANCE

Unless you’re on call to assist during a deploy or maintenance job outside business hours we respect your personal time.
You can disable Slack during weekends and after 6 pm 😉

AGILE IS THE WAY

We work in 6-week cycles. Every 6 weeks we release a batch of improvements to the user acceptance server (and 2 weeks later to the production server)
The cycle is split into three 2-week sprints. Together with the product manager, the product delivery team defines the work for each sprint."

One sunny Barcelona morning, two designers sat down to build a beautiful lead generation form for a bathroom company's showroom. They ended up reimagining the data collection experience, and realised it was one idea they wouldn't flush down the toilet. Today, Typeform is a team of over 400 people from more than 35 countries, with offices in Barcelona, Spain and San Francisco, US.

We're building a world where brands, businesses, and their communities can have more personal relationships with the people who matter most. To do this, we give people the tools they need to have conversational experiences at scale—because meaningful relationships start with conversations.

From online lead forms and engaging quizzes, to face-to-face encounters in the office, help us build more meaningful relationships, one conversation at a time.

And we use the power of search to help people and organizations turn that possibility into results. Elastic is the leading platform for search-powered solutions. With solutions in Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security, we help improve customer and employee search experiences, keep critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats. Elastic enables organizations worldwide to use the power of Elastic, including Netflix, Uber, BBC, Microsoft, and thousands of others.

Elastic was built on a foundation of being free and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organization and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture.

The Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications. Elasticsearch is an efficient datastore for logs, metrics, and application traces, supporting the three pillars of observability. The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, Logs, and Uptime solutions. When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, how do we store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, how do we present this information to the user, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market.

As a Senior Full-Stack Engineer on the Observability team, you'll primarily be working on UIs and APIs in Kibana devoted to curated observability users. You'll be working with the UI team and product management to build high quality, intuitive and innovative UIs and robust APIs to drive the experience.

Engineering philosophy

We believe that engineering complex, pluggable software for the web that is built to last the test of time is both tricky and exciting. Doing so requires a team of diverse individuals, with sharp minds and the ability to empathize with our users, working together with mutual respect and a common mission.

We care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you're working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible throughout our organization. At Elastic, hierarchy does not determine how decisions get made. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on anything, regardless of their role within the company.


Work on new and exciting Elastic products.
Develop the APM, Logs, Metrics, Integrations, Agent Management UIs and APIs in Kibana.
Collaborate with fellow JavaScript engineers.
Collaborate with product design, server team, agent engineers and the Kibana team.

JavaScript programming skills

Strong preference for Open Source experience
Ability to work independently

You might have

Experience with React and Typescript
Experience with Node.js
Experience writing automated tests

Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life. Your age is only a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.

We strive to have parity of benefits across regions and while regulations differ from place to place, we believe taking care of our people is the right thing to do.
