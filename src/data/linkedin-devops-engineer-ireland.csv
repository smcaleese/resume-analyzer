Business Operations plays a key role in leading the DevOps transformation at Mastercard through our tooling and by being an advocate for change and standards throughout the development, quality, release, and product organizations.

We accomplish this transformation through supporting daily operations with a hyper focus on triage and then root cause by understanding the business impact of our products. The goal of every biz ops team is to shift left to be more proactive and upfront in the development process, and to proactively manage production and change activities to maximize customer experience, and increase the overall value of supported applications. Biz Ops teams also focus on risk management by tying all our activities together with an overarching responsibility for compliance and risk mitigation across all our environments. A biz ops focus is also on streamlining and standardizing traditional application specific support activities and centralizing points of interaction for both internal and external partners by communicating effectively with all key stakeholders.

Ultimately, the role of biz ops is to align Product and Customer Focused priorities with Operational needs. We regularly review our run state not only from an internal perspective, but also understanding and providing the feedback loop to our development partners on how we can improve the customer experience of our applications.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

All Activities Involving Access To Mastercard Assets, Information, And Networks Comes With An Inherent Risk To The Organization And, Therefore, It Is Expected That Every Person Working For, Or On Behalf Of, Mastercard Is Responsible For Information Security And Must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

773862d49aa74d58a9bfd80492b888ea,Personio,Senior Devops Engineer - Tech Platform,"Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland","THE ROLE




At Personio we are on the amazing journey of exponential customer and product growth. After our recent $125M Series D funding we are the most valuable HR tech company in Europe and we are investing heavily in our Technology Platform.




The mission of the Technology Platform tribe is to ensure Personio is built and operated with excellence. We are responsible for ensuring our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and ensuring our engineers have the tools and infrastructure to achieve this. We measure engineering excellence through core metrics of software development delivery. We use these metrics to drive initiatives that enable our peer engineering teams to build, test, deploy, monitor and operate Personio to the highest industry standards. We believe that technical engineering excellence is the foundation for product development excellence and the foundation of Personio’s success as a company.




In the Developer Experience (DX) team, we enable our own developers to build, test and deploy code quickly, easily and reliably on their own. We focus on maximising engineering effectiveness, by developing and distributing robust and practical development tools, building scalable devops processes, and advocating for software development best practices.

The DX Engineer is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organisation. We support our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, and we play a key role in enabling them to deprecate our monolith and create a highly scalable microservices architecture with modern tech stacks.

Do you get excited about developer tools, build pipelines, continuous delivery and deploying, running and monitoring highly scalable applications on Kubernetes? Are you interested in guiding, helping and sharing knowledge with fellow developers? Are you eager to solve the challenges that engineers face to improve the entire department’s productivity and provide a delightful developer experience? Then this role is for you!




Responsibilities

You will research, engineer and experiment with new ways to improve developer workflows and devops practices to reduce our Lead Time to Production and increase Deployment Frequency
You will maintain and improve Personio’s dev environments and build infrastructure. Your scope will include everything from how services are developed and tested locally, to how they are built and integration-tested using our Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, to how they are rolled out, run and monitored in our production Kubernetes cluster.
You will foster relationships and work closely with product teams to support them in the migration of our monolith to microservices architecture, understand their challenges and propose result-oriented solutions to improve their productivity.
You will also spend time teaching engineers (especially new joiners) how to use our tools, whether by giving internal talks, organising internal onboarding workshops or writing documentation and tutorials.




How we work:

We are transforming our PHP application into Golang and Kotlin microservices!
We are a product company so our teams are organised in a mission-based cross-functional fashion. You will work in the Tech Platform, alongside other Backend/Devops Engineer, SRE, Security Engineers and QA Engineers
We have a “you built it, you run it” attitude and CI/CD is our second nature - we use AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and GitLab to implement it!




WHAT YOU NEED TO SUCCEED

What skills you should bring:




Over 5 years of software engineering experience building and designing scalable applications, tools or distributed systems. You understand the needs of software engineers working in product teams, you’ve been in their shoes, and can empathise with them. You want to help your fellow engineers to achieve maximum efficiency.
You have a strong expertise with at least one of our tech stacks: Java/Kotlin (JVM, Gradle, SpringBoot), PHP (Laravel) or Golang. In particular you’re comfortable with the intricacies of their build ecosystems (build tools, tasks runners, etc.) and you understand how to monitor and manage them in a containerised production environment.
You have a deep understanding and an interest for DevOps tools and technologies such as: Kubernetes, AWS, Sentry, DataDog, Docker, Git/Gitlab, Flagger, and Linkerd, as well as deployment automation (CI/CD pipelines, blue/green and canary deployments).
You’re comfortable writing, documenting and distributing robust and delightful scripts, CLI tools and plugins for developers (we mostly use Golang and Python for that).
You’re interested in development processes and practices (merge requests, approvals, trunk-based vs branch-based development, etc), and are eager to optimise them.
You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services, and you like writing great technical documentation and useful tutorials.
You love data driven decision making and the metrics of Developer Experience - Lead Time and Deployment Frequency.
You have an excellent written and spoken English (level C1/C2 on the CEFR scale)
We are experiencing rapid growth and are “building our plane while flying it” so bring your agile mindset to the table!
You embrace feedback - no one is perfect, neither are we. So let’s make this an opportunity to praise and learn from each other.
Finally, you have a good sense of humour. Have fun with us, learn with us from mistakes and bring your good vibes!







Why Personio




As you are joining Personio at such an early stage, this shows us your trust and confidence in us. We would like you to profit from the success of the company, and therefore, we offer you a competitive compensation package (salary, benefits and pre-IPO equity)
We love what we do, but we are still happy to enjoy 26 days of paid holidays + 2 days off for Christmas and New Years
We enjoy becoming better day by day, that is why you will receive €1,500 of development budget every year
We have fun! Join us for regular team events, e.g. Oktoberfest, summer event, skiing trip and online events in lieu of Covid-19 restrictions
We focus on results rather than schedules - we offer Flexibility and Remote-working
Comprehensive healthcare scheme fully covered for each permanent employee
Pension scheme, up to 5% matching contribution
Corporate benefits - a range of employee discounts for different brands so you can save money while shopping (e.g. Adidas, LG, Bosch, Apple, Dia, etc.)
#SocialResponsibility: We are grateful for our privileges and take action to have a positive impact on the environment and society. Therefore, you will have two extra days to have #Impact: one individual and one supporting a company-wide project!




The well-being of our employees is paramount. Although we’ve recently opened our Dublin office in the Docklands area all employees are currently working from home, the office or a combination of the two at their discretion due to Covid-19.

Personio is an equal opportunities employer and does not discriminate on the grounds of gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or being a member of the traveller community."
