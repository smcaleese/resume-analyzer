The AWS Reliability Engineering team is building systems to ensure these AWS customers can rely on the highest-availability, lowest-latency cloud platform on the planet. We work closely with the teams who own the largest AWS products, building systems to detect and mitigate operational issues before they impact customers. We are looking for a knowledgeable and experienced senior software development engineer to help us succeed in this mission.

As a Software Development Engineer at AWS Reliability, you will lead the team in the design and implementation of systems which automate fault containment, problem diagnosis, and issue resolution across multiple hugely-distributed, always-on architectures.

As the scale and complexity of AWS grows, this is the best way that we can offer our customers a stable and reliable cloud computing platform. We succeed once these systems detect, diagnose, and repair operational defects without customer impact or human intervention.

You will work with teams across AWS to drive adoption of the software that has been built by the team, and influence systems development practices for new and existing products. You will define availability goals for service teams across AWS, and strategies to make these goals attainable with minimal effort. Your goal will be to remove human-error from the day-to-day operations of the massive, always-on, distributed systems which make up AWS.

Within your first year on the AWS Reliability team, you will have met with senior technical leaders from across AWS, designed and implemented at least one new system, and you will have dived deep into the causes of at least one historic external customer impacting event, and determined how to prevent a similar event from ever happening again. As your career continues to develop, you will influence the growth and direction not only of the Reliability team, but of the AWS group as a whole.

Our goal is to give people honest, unbiased advice, with the information they need to make the right decision. And, because of how complicated insurance is, we offer tools, articles, and support where people can reach out to a human about problems or questions they have.

Very flexible remote work policy. You'll only be requested to travel to Berlin occasionally.
A modern tech stack to work with—TypeScript, React, NextJS, Cypress, and GitHub Actions, just to name a few.

What you bring to the table
Significant experience as a frontend engineer with strong knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and with a sound understanding of modern frameworks and libraries such as React.js.
Strong testing knowledge—we're using Jest for Unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end testing, and Loki for visual regression.
Experience with static typing and code analysis. We're using TypeScript for most of our projects.
Experience using a component-oriented approach and thinking in a reusable way. Our design system is a great example of that.
Some experience using state management libraries like Redux (optional).
An interest in user experience and user interface. You'll need to think both for mobile and desktop with the proper use of HTML semantics.

We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain, which is why our tech stack centres around JavaScript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with a growing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.

We rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base.

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

Our small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas. Using continuous deployment, we quickly see our changes in the product and make fast iterations. Our engineers focus on creating polished products and writing high quality code by designing APIs and abstractions that are extensible and maintainable. As an engineering team, Quora also highly values development velocity, and invests heavily in improvements to tools, abstractions, and frameworks to empower developers to move faster and achieve more with a lean team. Everyone on the engineering team has a huge impact on our product and our company.

The Product Platform team is focused on making product developers (product engineers, designers, data scientists) more productive, by building tools, frameworks and abstractions that make developers' life easier. This team's projects range from building library of reusable UI components, improving frontend debugging tools, making code deploy faster, to optimizing site performance. Recently, this team led large-scale migration of Quora's legacy frontend system to React, GraphQL and Relay , and there is plenty of interesting and impactful challenges to improve our frontend frameworks and systems in this modern architecture.

In this role, you’ll be working with other members of the team across a variety of projects to improve efficiency of product developers. You’ll be working mainly with Python and Javascript, particularly with React, GraphQL and Relay.


Lead initiatives to build and maintain core UI components used by product developers at Quora.
Collaborate with Product Designers and fellow Software Engineers to improve quality of frontend codebase to make product developers more efficient.
Play a major role in team planning by creating actionable plans with proper prioritization.
Provide technical guidance and mentorship to peers, allowing team knowledge to grow.
Understand developer pain points and common questions in frontend development, and aim to improve or answer them.
 Minimum Requirements

Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here 
4+ years of experience working with large scale codebases and systems, particularly web applications and frontend architecture.
4+ years of experience building APIs that are used by large teams.
2+ years of experience working with React and GraphQL, or similar frameworks.
A passion for learning and always improving yourself and the team around you
Strong communication and interpersonal skills.
 Preferred Qualifications

Experience optimizing the client-side performance of web applications
Passion for Quora's mission and goals
Passion for code quality and designing elegant systems.

Our development culture and values?

When you want to apply, you probably have loads of questions. Let us try to answer some already. Below we summarized our development culture and how our values translate into daily practices.

START-TO-FINISH OWNERSHIP

Our product delivery teams accept a high level of autonomy. You take ownership and show the ability to decide and act for the good of the product.

FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS

Remote work is possible but face to face collaboration is encouraged.
If possible, we do try to work together, at least 1 day a week. Great for some face to face bonding with your colleagues.
You can start whenever you want. We have a short stand up meeting (remote) at 10 am, but if we need to rearrange we can discuss it with the team.

LIGHT MEETINGS

We prevent meetings from overwhelming an engineer’s schedule and protect your ‘maker time’ as much as possible. We only do a short status update every morning at 10 am.
Twice a week the engineering team has a coffee talk in which the participants rant freely or discuss interesting things that they have found
Every 6 weeks we do a company-wide half-day meeting to learn from our colleagues (customer success managers, support, sales, marketing, …). These meetings are intended to learn, but also to socialize with colleagues and understand how we impact our customers.

PRODUCT-DRIVEN

The product managers are closely involved with the development team.
You’ll always have a clear view of the direction the product is going and why.
Priorities can change but are always discussed together. New things coming in the sprint means other stuff is going out.

WORK/LIFE BALANCE

Unless you’re on call to assist during a deploy or maintenance job outside business hours we respect your personal time.
You can disable Slack during weekends and after 6 pm 😉

AGILE IS THE WAY

We work in 6-week cycles. Every 6 weeks we release a batch of improvements to the user acceptance server (and 2 weeks later to the production server)
The cycle is split into three 2-week sprints. Together with the product manager, the product delivery team defines the work for each sprint."

Calculating commissions is mission-critical. And it’s really, really hard. Each company has a unique commission structure that involves far more calculations and data than a typical salary payroll — and for many, commission is one of the largest expenses on the P&L statement.

When CaptivateIQ was founded in 2017, compensation leaders were tracking and managing sales data using costly legacy software or, in the worst cases, a single spreadsheet. There were no other options but to use opaque, error-prone processes to manage commissions. Our founders knew this could be better. So they created the solution that they’d want to use: CaptivateIQ.

Today, the best teams use CaptivateIQ to strategically manage and maximize the power of incentives. Twenty-eight of the Forbes Cloud 100, including leading brands like Amplitude, Gong, and Hopin, use CaptivateIQ to power their commission programs. We have over $164.6M in funding from ICONIQ, Sequoia, Accel, Workday Ventures, Sapphire, Y Combinator, Amity Ventures, GTMFund, S28 Capital, and other top investors. We’ve grown over 3x by all measures in the past year – including revenue, customers, and employees – and we’re searching for more great folks such as yourself to help us transform the world of commission management.

We’re proud of our 5.0 rating on Glassdoor. Our remote team comes from diverse backgrounds and experiences, which helps us better serve our customers and each other. People are at the heart of our open and inclusive organization, and we bring transparency, humility, and respect to everything that we do.

You will build a redesigned experience catered to the largest user base on our platform. Sales reps are motivated by competition, treating the thrill of closing more deals than their colleagues as sport. They also need to be on-the-go and on-the-phone, at a moment’s notice, in order to beat their competition. The mission of the Payee team is to bring a first-class experience to the fingertips of sales reps, providing visibility into their incentives in order to motivate them to close their next deal.

Behind every great software company is the team building it. We are an engineering team of multicultural, highly collaborative, fully distributed, humble learners. We pride ourselves on building best-in-class products powered by innovative technologies.

Responsibilities

Build and architect a modern web application from the ground up using the latest frontend technologies
Collaborate with Product and Design to translate ambiguous product requirements into delightful experiences

In December 2021, Sperax released USDs on L2 Arbitron. Residing on-chain, USDs is backed by collateral and algorithmically by the protocol’s ability to mint $1 worth of SPA when redeeming $1 of USDs. USDs combine the scalability benefits of algorithmic stablecoins with the stability benefits of collateralized stablecoins.

USDs holders benefit from native auto-yield, meaning that holders automatically earn yield without having to stake or claim. The yield is generated organically from the collateral deployed on external Defi protocols like Curve Finance.

Sperax’s roadmap is to construct a full-stack Defi ecosystem based on USDs. As the USDs ecosystem expands through organic and partnership growth, the team plans to vitalize the L1 conceived during the company’s incipient stage.

The Cloud Team At Grafana Labs

Grafana Cloud is a composable observability platform, integrating metrics and logs with Grafana. Many organizations do not want to spend the resources to host their own Grafana, or are seeking extra reliability or scalability for their monitoring by choosing to host monitoring separately from their infrastructure. We make data intake into Grafana easier by providing data source integrations with prebuilt dashboards and alerts for common use cases. We want customers to easily and reliably monitor all of their servers and applications with Grafana Cloud.

We are looking for Frontend Engineers that are passionate about communicating with data and providing seamless experiences for our customers to join our growing team! Our stack is Typescript + React (interacting with backends written in Golang). Frontend Engineers at Grafana also have the opportunity to contribute to Open Source communities.

What You'll Work On

As a Frontend Engineer, you will be working on the frontend for one of our cloud products. You could also be contributing to one of our open-source projects, or on a new green-field project in the monitoring/observability space.

Collaborate with Product, UX, and graphic designers to turn their designs into great user experiences.
Implement visual designs using clean, reusable components.
Expand and improve our core libraries that other teams and the plugin ecosystem depend on. (Examples: Page layouts, menus, drawer, plugin build tools.)


We Look For Teammates That Possess The Following Skills

You are comfortable working in a remote-first company; communication is key.
For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind, and respectful. We operate by consensus. You can contribute to a discussion, disagree constructively, and commit to the team’s decision. You are able to communicate design decisions clearly in written and spoken English.
You have at least a couple of years of experience as a Frontend developer. We are a small team of six, working remotely, on a product that will be used by engineers all over the world – the ability to work on your own is crucial.
You have a good understanding of a software development process that takes a user-centered approach. You easily build an understanding of the users’ context and goals which will help you build the right solution with the maximum value.
You know how to transform ideas into working code – you are able to design a solution, get feedback, and write a prototype by yourself.
You enjoy working on complex solutions – Grafana is a highly technological solution and has avid followers who rely on it every day and who care deeply about their workflows. You value code maintainability, readability & automation.
You are able to troubleshoot modern web application issues and work with profilers, debuggers, bundlers, and testing libraries.
Familiarity with Linux and any of Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB or Elasticsearch is also an advantage.
