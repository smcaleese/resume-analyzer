About The Team

As we grow the Peakon engineering team at Workday, we are looking for an experienced Backend Engineer to join one of your product teams based in Dublin. Peakon teams own their roadmap, work collaboratively and include engineering, UI/UX design, and product management.

The Peakon team at Workday is driven by the belief that we can radically change the world of work. We believe that when an organisation listens to employee feedback and empowers every employee to drive the change they want to see, it can create more fulfilling jobs and grow in ways never before imagined.

We’re in the business of creating great places to work, so it should be no surprise that being a great place to work is our highest priority. With ambitions as big as ours, we see individual growth and development as the key strategy for growing our business.

About The Role

Your focus will be to contribute to the development, architecture, and evolution of the Peakon platform.

You will be a key contributor in technical and architectural discussions within the backend engineering team, working closely with peers and engineering leaders to drive the technical direction of our platform forward.

Additionally, you will spend part of your time collaborating with peers, through regular code reviews and pair programming.

As part of the Peakon team at Workday, you'll:

Regularly review and discuss other engineer’s code
Contribute to architectural discussions with other engineers across all levels
Use your technical expertise to contribute towards building a best-in-class product


Our tech

We make it a priority to stay on the cutting edge of tech. We are highly motivated by learning and growing in our roles, and constantly evolving is a key part of that.

We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain, which is why our tech stack centres around JavaScript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with a growing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.

We rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base.

We use Buildkite for continuous integration to make sure our most recent changes are always available to test, and we deploy code to our production environment every day.

About You

Basic Qualifications

3+ years of experience with backend development
You have worked in a team setting, using collaborative tools for version control, code reviews and project management


Other Qualifications

You are familiar with a Node.js based ecosystem or willing to put in the extra work at the beginning to make the switch
You have experience building web applications with an understanding of scalability, high availability, latency and throughput
You are open to opinions of others and constructively discuss solutions to find the best one for the challenge at hand
You are able to quickly and accurately break down, estimate, prioritise, and deliver projects of high technical complexity
You have excellent verbal and written communication skills in English


We welcome your application even if you do not meet all of the criteria listed above, but are passionate about the opportunity of mastering this role. We know that skills are not static and growth is continuous, so we are happy to help you take your career to the next level together and are committed to your development as part of the Peakon team at Workday.

Amazon Web Services is the largest consumer cloud offering in the world, powering cutting edge science, rapidly growing start-ups and industry-leading companies.

The AWS Reliability Engineering team is building systems to ensure these AWS customers can rely on the highest-availability, lowest-latency cloud platform on the planet. We work closely with the teams who own the largest AWS products, building systems to detect and mitigate operational issues before they impact customers. We are looking for a knowledgeable and experienced senior software development engineer to help us succeed in this mission.

As a Software Development Engineer at AWS Reliability, you will lead the team in the design and implementation of systems which automate fault containment, problem diagnosis, and issue resolution across multiple hugely-distributed, always-on architectures. These systems will take metric and dependency data from multiple sources and analyze them, correlating them with customer impact to determine root cause of an issue without human intervention. As the scale and complexity of AWS grows, this is the best way that we can offer our customers a stable and reliable cloud computing platform. We succeed once these systems detect, diagnose, and repair operational defects without customer impact or human intervention.

You will work with teams across AWS to drive adoption of the software that has been built by the team, and influence systems development practices for new and existing products. You will define availability goals for service teams across AWS, and strategies to make these goals attainable with minimal effort. Your goal will be to remove human-error from the day-to-day operations of the massive, always-on, distributed systems which make up AWS.

Within your first year on the AWS Reliability team, you will have met with senior technical leaders from across AWS, designed and implemented at least one new system, and you will have dived deep into the causes of at least one historic external customer impacting event, and determined how to prevent a similar event from ever happening again. As your career continues to develop, you will influence the growth and direction not only of the Reliability team, but of the AWS group as a whole.

At Workday, we help the world’s largest organizations adapt to what’s next by bringing finance, HR, and planning into a single enterprise cloud. We work hard, and we’re serious about what we do. But we like to have fun, too. We put people first, celebrate diversity, drive innovation, and do good in the communities where we live and work.

About The Team

As we grow the Peakon engineering team at Workday, we are looking for an experienced Frontend Engineer to join us in Dublin. Peakon teams own their roadmap, work collaboratively and include engineering, UI/UX design, and product management.

The Peakon team at Workday is driven by the belief that we can radically change the world of work. We believe that when an organisation listens to employee feedback and empowers every employee to drive the change they want to see, it can create more fulfilling jobs and grow in ways never before imagined.

We’re in the business of creating great places to work, so it should be no surprise that being a great place to work is our highest priority. With ambitions as big as ours, we see individual growth and development as the key strategy for growing our business.

About The Role

Your focus will be to develop and evolve the Peakon frontend application, and the tools surrounding it. You will be implementing new features and products, creating delightful user experiences in close collaboration with other engineers and UX/UI designers.

You will contribute to technical discussions within the frontend team, work closely with peers, and participate in setting the technical direction for the frontend team.

Build features that help employees drive the change they want to see at their workplace
Regularly review and discuss other engineer’s code 
Use your technical expertise to contribute towards building a best-in-class product


Our tech

We make it a priority to stay on the cutting edge of tech. We are highly motivated by learning and growing in our roles, and constantly evolving is a key part of that.

We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain, which is why our tech stack centers around JavaScript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. To prevent runtime errors in our frontend applications, we have recently introduced TypeScript. Ultimately we believe that our tech stack needs to evolve as our industry evolves.

We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with a growing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.

We rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base.

We use Buildkite for continuous integration to make sure our most recent changes are always available to test, and we deploy code to our production environment every day.

About You

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS

You have worked in a team setting, using collaborative tools for version control, code reviews and project management


Other Qualifications

You are a zealot about automated testing around your code (unit, integration, functional); you will have employed other DevOps practices such as continuous integration, and continuous deployment or delivery

Test. You are someone who doesn’t write code without tests to prove it works, perhaps you are even a test-first type of person.  You have worked also with full integration or end-to-end automated test frameworks.

Be humble.  We’re not looking for self-described rock stars, rather engineers who are sharp and confident in their skills but also open to being wrong and willing to learn from others.

They wanted to create insurance products that were as simple as they knew it could be.
 
 That’s why we’re building insurance to make all interactions easier and more transparent: from signing up and filing a claim to canceling. Our goal is to give people honest, unbiased advice, with the information they need to make the right decision. And, because of how complicated insurance is, we offer tools, articles, and support where people can reach out to a human about problems or questions they have.
 
 Currently, Feather has helped people from over 150 countries get insurance digitally and is expanding quickly.
 
 Intro
 We're looking for a frontend engineer to help us build and scale our web app. You'll be working mostly with TypeScript, NextJS, ReactJS and other modern frameworks. We value individuals who are effective communicators, highly empathetic, and user-focused.
 
 Why work at Feather? 
Small team, flat hierarchy, mission driven. The usual buzzwords here, except we actually mean them. We’re small, lean, and we love what we’re doing.
You’ll be building a product that people need, and are grateful for. Our excellent Trustpilot and Google reviews speak for themselves. We’ve built a product around people, and they love it!
Budget for learning. We want you to grow with us, so we offer a €1,200 yearly budget that you can spend to learn new stuff (books, conferences, subscriptions, etc.).
Very flexible remote work policy. You'll only be requested to travel to Berlin occasionally.
A modern tech stack to work with—TypeScript, React, NextJS, Cypress, and GitHub Actions, just to name a few.
 
 What you bring to the table 
Significant experience as a frontend engineer with strong knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and with a sound understanding of modern frameworks and libraries such as React.js.
Strong testing knowledge—we're using Jest for Unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end testing, and Loki for visual regression.
Experience with static typing and code analysis. We're using TypeScript for most of our projects.
Experience using a component-oriented approach and thinking in a reusable way. Our design system is a great example of that.
Some experience using state management libraries like Redux (optional).
An interest in user experience and user interface. You'll need to think both for mobile and desktop with the proper use of HTML semantics.
 
 Don’t be afraid to apply even if you’re missing a few bullet points in there! We’ll be delighted to help you learn new skills. 
 
 You'll be responsible for 
Make technical decisions on how to best build and scale performant web applications with a focus on accessibility.
Keep up to date with the latest trends in technology—and propose new ideas for our website and app.
Contribute to our open-source efforts. Our design system (dirtyswan.design) is fully open-source!
Work closely with all of the individuals within a cross-functional team. You'll be speaking to the whole chain, from our customers down to our backend engineers.
 
 Does this sound like a good fit for you? Apply now! 
At Feather, we are huge advocates for diversity and inclusion. From LGBTQ+ events to open discussions about eliminating bias, we highly encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply.
We encourage people without degrees to apply: we believe that what you’ve worked on and achieved is way more important than on-paper qualifications.
