COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we‚Äôre all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we‚Äôve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

DESCRIPTION

Does solving technical challenges in cloud computing motivate you? Come join the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) team and help us innovate solutions for databases in the AWS cloud!

The RDS team is the largest cloud database business in the world, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are automated by our control systems. Providing simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovation in our system to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale.

RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability require control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate global distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases and a wide variety of customer workloads. Also, we know how to have a good time as a team, we celebrate our successes, have team building events and celebrate birthdays and other life events.

As a part of a close-knit team of engineers that are agile, data driven, and highly collaborative, you will work with a wide variety of cutting edge technology to automate enterprise level databases with high reliability at massive scale. You will have the opportunity to propose ideas that positively impact our customers, owning major deliverables end-to-end, while working closely with experienced engineers and teams to execute on them. We value innovation and technical exploration through iterative development which includes project scoping & development practices that emphasize software excellence.

*Inclusive Team Culture*

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon‚Äôs culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

*Work/Life Balance*

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn‚Äôt about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it‚Äôs about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one day a month. We don‚Äôt like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause and prioritize fixes to reduce operational load on team.

*Mentorship & Career Growth*

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we‚Äôre building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Amazon Web Services is the largest consumer cloud offering in the world, powering cutting edge science, rapidly growing start-ups and industry-leading companies.

The AWS Reliability Engineering team is building systems to ensure these AWS customers can rely on the highest-availability, lowest-latency cloud platform on the planet. We work closely with the teams who own the largest AWS products, building systems to detect and mitigate operational issues before they impact customers. We are looking for a knowledgeable and experienced senior software development engineer to help us succeed in this mission.

As a Senior Software Development Engineer at AWS Reliability, you will lead the team in the design and implementation of systems which automate fault containment, problem diagnosis, and issue resolution across multiple hugely-distributed, always-on architectures. These systems will take metric and dependency data from multiple sources and analyze them, correlating them with customer impact to determine root cause of an issue without human intervention. As the scale and complexity of AWS grows, this is the best way that we can offer our customers a stable and reliable cloud computing platform. We succeed once these systems detect, diagnose, and repair operational defects without customer impact or human intervention.

You will work with teams across AWS to drive adoption of the software that has been built by the team, and influence systems development practices for new and existing products. You will define availability goals for service teams across AWS, and strategies to make these goals attainable with minimal effort. Your goal will be to remove human-error from the day-to-day operations of the massive, always-on, distributed systems which make up AWS.

Within your first year on the AWS Reliability team, you will have met with senior technical leaders from across AWS, designed and implemented at least one new system, and you will have dived deep into the causes of at least one historic external customer impacting event, and determined how to prevent a similar event from ever happening again. As your career continues to develop, you will influence the growth and direction not only of the Reliability team, but of the AWS group as a whole.
