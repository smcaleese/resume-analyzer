We believe that when an organisation listens to employee feedback and empowers every employee to drive the change they want to see, it can create more fulfilling jobs and grow in ways never before imagined.

We’re in the business of creating great places to work, so it should be no surprise that being a great place to work is our highest priority. With ambitions as big as ours, we see individual growth and development as the key strategy for growing our business.

About The Role

Your focus will be to contribute to the development, architecture, and evolution of the Peakon platform.

You will be a key contributor in technical and architectural discussions within the backend engineering team, working closely with peers and engineering leaders to drive the technical direction of our platform forward.

Use your technical expertise to contribute towards building a best-in-class product


Our tech

We make it a priority to stay on the cutting edge of tech. We are highly motivated by learning and growing in our roles, and constantly evolving is a key part of that.

We believe there is great value in a shared toolchain, which is why our tech stack centres around JavaScript, with Node.js on the server and React on the frontend. Some tasks are better solved with different tools, and thus we use Python for the data science parts of the system.

We are primarily hosted on Heroku and AWS, with a growing number of our services moving to the latter. We use PostgreSQL (through RDS), Redis and ElasticSearch for storage.

We rely heavily on automated testing on all levels of the application, with thousands of tests checking every commit to our code base.

We use Buildkite for continuous integration to make sure our most recent changes are always available to test, and we deploy code to our production environment every day.

About You

Basic Qualifications

3+ years of experience with backend development
You have worked in a team setting, using collaborative tools for version control, code reviews and project management


Other Qualifications

You are familiar with a Node.js based ecosystem or willing to put in the extra work at the beginning to make the switch
You have experience building web applications with an understanding of scalability, high availability, latency and throughput
You are open to opinions of others and constructively discuss solutions to find the best one for the challenge at hand
You are able to quickly and accurately break down, estimate, prioritise, and deliver projects of high technical complexity
You have excellent verbal and written communication skills in English

U.S. Remote or Ireland

We're a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University. Our Chairman is Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky is a member of our advisory board, both globally recognized leaders in AI/NLP.

We are poised to redefine how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that's excited about getting us there. You will be working with modern tech such as Kotlin, Architecture Components and Jetpack libraries. Your ability to add new and critical features to Woebot while also refactoring parts of our current system will help provide the fuel that will help us get there.

Ramping Up

Within your first 30 days: You will learn the major components of Woebot's codebase, be able to fix minor bugs, and be proficient with our development, build, and release process. 
Equally important, you will build relationships with other engineers, as well as design, product, and clinical teams.


Solve Problems That Matter

By day 60 you will begin to develop an understanding of the product and codebase, including UI, API calls, and app architecture. 
You've delivered at least one large feature or several smaller features with high quality and minimal bugs. Examples below: 
You might add screens that allow our users to reflect back on some of the thoughts they have shared with Woebot 
You might add an accessibility feature like talk back in order to allow Woebot to help a more diverse group of users.
You're developing features that help change our users' lives. To achieve this, you're: 
Writing clean code that you have manually tested.
Creating automated tests to ensure features don't break in the future. 
Giving and receiving feedback with other engineers and having a humble growth mindset. 

Become A Key Member Of The Mobile Team

By day 90 you'll be able to work with a senior Android engineer on feature feasibility and help estimate story points for more complex features. 
We work in small teams and value everyone's opinion. You'll work directly with product managers, user interaction designers, and graphic designers to provide technical feedback that will help us create the best product for our users.
You'll also write clear story descriptions, craft detailed Github Pull Requests, and leave code better than you found it.


Your Growth Opportunity

Beyond Day 90 you will work diligently to advance our mobile app, delivering on time and with great quality. You'll be an advocate for implementing native Android features that align with upcoming Android SDKs.
You will learn to architect solutions for new features, increasingly building the skills needed for a senior Android Engineer role.
Long term, you'll improve your ability to interface with other teams, write technical design documents, and learn to lead projects from conception to completion.
You will work on regulated medical products that must adhere to the highest quality standards. As a result, you will become a master of your craft, obsessed with delivering code that meets a very high bar and is free of defects.


Role-specific competencies

You have 2-3 years of production experience with native Android app development
You have experience implementing Kotlin based Android apps, knowledge of Android SDKs, and a strong grasp of modern Android development best practices.
You have a rich understanding of the technical nuances and trade-offs of the Android platform, including visual elements, security, and privacy.
You've worked on and supported high quality Apps in the Google Play Store (ideally 20K+ users)


Our Core Values

Empathic: You're a compassionate person and a team player motivated to understand others and help them be successful, too. You care as deeply for your colleagues as you do for our mission and our users.
Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you've got.
Strong work-ethic: You've mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

Play your part and contribute to category-leading apps that delight millions.




A few examples of your responsibilities:

Contribute to product development and product roadmap planning. Take a proactive role and ownership of the products you work on.
Help define the software architecture of new apps or new features for existing apps—and then develop them. The work spans broadly, from engineering and coding features to polishing world-class user interfaces.
Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base, where necessary.
Expand our set of libraries as needed to make yourself and other engineers more efficient and effective.
Stay up-to-speed with new mobile technologies and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities to boost our productivity and the enjoyment of our work.




What we offer

Huge impact. You’ll be working on products improving millions of lives around the world. The quality of your work will make a decisive difference to our users and to the trajectory of the Bending Spoons mission.
Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. You’ll get the chance to teach (and learn from) some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. We're all about growth, collaboration, and support. Your talent is going to blossom here.
Cool tech stack. We strive to use the best, most modern tools and technologies, and when they fall short of our expectations, we invent our own. It’s a geek’s paradise.
Own products. We don’t work for clients—we only develop our own apps. Freed from client-provider politics, we can move fast and be daring.
Continuous education. As relentless seekers of knowledge, we pay for your Italian/English language lessons and offer an unlimited book budget—but that's not where it ends. If you make a good case for some extra learning, we're delighted to foot the tab.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose (even no time at all, if you’d prefer). Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. Every day, you’ve got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. Morning person? Start work while the world’s still sleeping. Night owl? Ramp things up while others are winding down. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day. That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited vacations. Take all the time you need to recharge your batteries—no permission process or vacation allowance here. Because a rested, relaxed, and refreshed Spooner is a happy and effective Spooner.
Top-of-the-market salary and stock options. Our total compensation is highly competitive and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance.
Lots. Of. Fun. Our incredible People Operations team organizes awesome events, such as team games, drinks, yoga classes, parties, and regular company-wide retreats. Recent destinations include Bali, Argentina, and Tanzania.
Top-notch HQ. Natural light, silent rooms, state-of-the-art hardware, fun-filled common spaces... the list never ends! You’ll certainly be in the right environment to do your best work. And, when it’s time to switch off, you can do so in style and comfort.
Relocation package. To ease your move to Milan (if you decide to relocate), the first three months of rent are on us. Visa support is provided for those who need it.







What we look for

Passion for the topic. You have a long-standing, proven passion for writing software. It’s a big plus if you have a demonstrable interest in developing mobile apps.
Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge. You learn new concepts and skills rapidly, and love to nerd out and go in-depth.
Drive. You’re energetic, hard-working, and persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done impeccably. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.
Pragmatism. Far from being too academic or obsessive in your perfectionism, you understand that speed is often as important as quality when getting things done in a competitive world.
Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring, forever hunting down new opportunities and testing fresh ideas. Rather than waiting to be told what to do, you go seek.
A knack for UX and attention to detail. You care about developing quality user experiences, and notice the details that make a difference. You get a kick out of making a UI or an animation just perfect.
Diligence, organization. You can be entrusted with responsibilities big and small.
Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to support your team with whatever it needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read and write proficiently, and speak at a conversational level in English.




Commitment & Contract

Full-time or part-time, fixed-term with possibility to extend contract or become a permanent spooner.




Location

Milan, Italy or remote. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks. You’re also welcome to work remotely, or part on-site, part-remote.




The recruiting process

If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit arbitrariness and human bias, all Bending Spoons hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee.

01da93f6a52244a1be12a2933e1f0749,CrowdStrike,iOS Engineer (Remote),"Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland Remote","At CrowdStrike we’re on a mission - to stop breaches. Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. Because of that we’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and talent. Our culture was purpose-built to be remote first, and we offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. If you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology with a team that makes a difference every day, let’s talk.

CrowdStrike is hiring a Software Engineer to join the Mobile Team working on CrowdStrike Falcon for iOS, one of CrowdStrike's sensors that provides Mobile Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR).

Our iOS engineers use Swift, mid- to low-level Operating System knowledge, and very high-quality standards to augment and improve our EDR capabilities, implement new features, and respond to customer requests.

We are looking for somebody who is keen to work with high-quality Swift code mixed with some mid- to low-level technologies, such as TCP/IP, DNS, ARM assembly, etc. We look for (but do not require) candidates with strong/deep knowledge of operating systems concepts, and experience working on UNIX systems (especially macOS or iOS), working with networking protocols, writing system-level software, or reverse-engineering ARM64/x86-64.

As a Software Engineer, you will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects, and collaborate with others to implement features. You will work on stimulating problems born out of the scale of our deployment, and the stringent quality, performance, and security requirements of our sensors.

This is a remote-friendly position. Even if you decide to work in one of our offices, we are located across the globe. We therefore expect you to be comfortable working in distributed teams, and to have excellent communication skills.

CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product.

One component is a “sensor”, installed on client devices that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.

The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.


Provide key contribution on the sensor development team involved in architecture, in implementation, and improvements to our Mobile Endpoint Detection & Response Security Software.
Develop features from design to delivery including participation in product demo at the end of the sprint.
Collaborate with multi-functional teams in various locations.
Devise innovative solutions to hard performance or scale problems.
Maintain the sensor up to date with the latest OS developments and patches.

Familiarity with core concepts of Operating Systems.
Excellent OS-level knowledge of macOS or iOS.
Strong experience with non-graphical Swift and C/C++ programming.
Experience designing and producing very high-quality software.
Able to communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team.

Able to lead & mentor, especially in a distributed team.
Familiarity working with other UNIX systems.
Familiarity with Objective-C.
Familiarity with ARM64/X86-64 assembly.
Familiarity with reverse-engineering.
Familiarity with UEMs/EMMs/MDMs.
Familiarity and experience with Agile process.
Familiarity with DevOps practices and technologies.
Familiarity with Python and shell scripting.

Remote-friendly culture
Market leader in compensation and equity awards
Wellness programs
A variety of professional development and mentorship opportunities
Open offices have stocked kitchens, coffee, soda and treats
Inclusive culture focused on people, customers and innovation

We are committed to building an inclusive culture of belonging that not only embraces the diversity of our people but also reflects the diversity of the communities in which we work and the customers we serve. We know that the happiest and highest performing teams include people with diverse perspectives that encourage new ways of solving problems, so we strive to attract and develop talent from all backgrounds and create workplaces where everyone feels seen, heard and empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work.

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Our team, Payment Products, works with the sellers who need Square the most: small businesses who depend on us to ease the burden of their payment processing. These sellers make up a substantial portion of Square's revenue, giving us a very powerful lever to contribute to our overall performance as a company.

This squad, Payment Products International, grows all non-US markets that Square Payments operates in (today this is Australia, Canada, France, Spain, Ireland, Japan, and United Kingdom), and prioritizing and launching new markets (10+ in the next few years). Additionally, the squad is focused on customizing and localizing our Payments offering to tailor the needs and customs of each market - a few examples being the removal of tipping for Japan and supporting different business structures across all markets.


Implement new market-specific payment methods
Help move the needle and scale up adoption in our international markets
Bring essential findings from international projects to the core of our apps
Provide the best UX for sellers and buyers
Help guide projects and features from the first brainstorm's line item to full roll-out
Contribute to Square's best-of-class open source projects

Qualifications

5+ years of industry experience
Be proficient in Swift or Objective-C for development (we use both).
Enjoy working on mobile apps at all levels – from networking up to user interfaces and everything in between.
Build high-availability and resilient systems which can accept and report payments no matter the network or device conditions.
Collaborate with iOS, Android, and Server engineers to ship features.
Work with product managers and designers to refine and establish product scope.
Respond to customer feedback to improve our products.

Block is a proud equal opportunity employer.

We've a number of new interesting projects booked, and need to continue to expand our team.

The pandemic has meant we're currently fully remote, but in the near future, we hope to return to our Dublin city centre office, in Strand Street Great, just near the Ha'penny bridge and Dublin's Italian Quarter. We are of course considering fully remote workers for this role, but our preference is for candidates to be working in a similar time zone to us. Our time zone is Irish Standard Time (IST).

Requirements

We're not hung up on education or qualifications. Yeah, we'll read it, but we're much more interested in what you've done.

We'd like to see some examples of your work. Specifically, apps you've worked on that are in the App Store or Play Store.

We want enthusiastic, motivated people who like to build apps and have a keen eye for UI/UX. We use Swift for iOS Apps and Kotlin for Android apps. We've also some work in React Native. As we've been developing apps for over 10 years, we do have some projects written in Objective C. Exposure to these is a plus, but not 100% necessary.

We use git for source control, YouTrack for bug tracking, Testrail for test case management, and TeamCity for continuous integration - But if you don't know these, we can help.

Benefits

Salary will be in line with experience. Tapadoo offer a generous health plan to all employees upon completion of a probation period.

Here's what we see as a major benefit:

Mobile apps are our core business. We eat, sleep and drink mobile apps. We're design led, and keep apace of what's going on in this industry. When you work at Tapadoo, you'll be able to showcase your efforts as they end up in the app store. Your contributions will be valued, and visible. You won't be ""the mobile app developer"" in a company whose core business is something completely different, left to work on a single app forever. Instead, you'll work on new and interesting projects on an ongoing basis.

So get in touch

We believe that a diverse team makes for better products and a better workplace. Our team come from all over the world and from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and life experiences. If you like the look of the job, but feel you don't meet all the requirements, feel free to drop us a mail at recruiting@tapadoo.com; We're happy to discuss the role and see if it may be a fit for you.

Stripe’s backend engineers work on the business logic for all of that. As a backend engineer, you will build and expand APIs and services and work with our partners to launch new markets, payment methods, and capabilities.

We have backend engineers in almost every team across Stripe, and in that role, you’ll be making some of the most significant decisions for the company. You’ll get to work with other engineers to build delightful features that span various parts of the system, as well as our business, sales and operations teams to understand and solve our users’ pain points.

We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building successful products or systems; you’re comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; you have exquisite attention to detail; and you’re comfortable learning new technologies and systems.


Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and systems across Stripe’s engineering teams
Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes

Enjoy and have experience building APIs
Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.

It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.


Build a new API for our users, or iterate on existing APIs
Launch a new market or payment method
Work with our Analytics and Fraud teams to reduce chargebacks and declines
Build new tools for our business teams
Build new systems to securely store sensitive data

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

8ad1f86e3f034aee9bd68aab651d7009,Woebot Health,Senior iOS Engineer,"Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland","Full Time, Remote

Our mission is to make the best mental health tools radically accessible to everyone.

We’re a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University. Our Chairman is Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky is a member of our advisory board, both globally recognized leaders in AI/NLP.

We are poised to redefine how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that’s excited about getting us there. You will be working with modern tech such as Swift programming with Protocol-oriented design. Your ability to add new and critical features to Woebot while also refactoring parts of our current system will help provide the fuel that will help us get there.

How You’ll Thrive

Ramping Up


Within your first 30 days: You will learn the major components of the codebase, be able to fix minor bugs, and be proficient with our development, build, and release process.
Equally important, you will build relationships with other engineers, as well as design, product, and clinical teams.


Solve Problems That Matter


By day 60 you will begin to develop an understanding of the product and codebase, including UI, API calls, and app architecture.
You’ve delivered at least one large feature or several smaller features with high quality and minimal bugs. Examples below:
You might add screens that allow our users to reflect back on some of the thoughts they have shared with Woebot
You might add a new feature in iOS 15 that will help the app get featured by Apple (again!). We’d love to hear your ideas on what this feature might be!
You’re developing features that help change our users’ lives. To achieve this, you’re:
Writing clean code that you have manually tested,
Creating automated tests to ensure features don’t break in the future.
Giving and receiving feedback with other engineers and having a humble growth mindset.

Become a Key Member of the Mobile Team


By day 90 you will be able to work with other engineers on feature feasibility and help estimate story points for more complex features.
We work in small teams and value everyone’s opinion. You’ll work directly with product managers, user interaction designers, and graphic designers to provide technical feedback that will help us create the best product for our users.
You'll also write clear story descriptions, craft detailed Github Pull Requests, and leave code better than you found it.


Growth Opportunity


Beyond Day 90 you will work diligently to advance our mobile app, delivering on time and with great quality.
You will be an advocate for implementing native iOS features that align with upcoming Apple SDKs.
For example, Woebot implemented Dark Mode soon after it was released, which helped us get featured in the App Store! You will help us continue to think long term and stay ahead of the curve.
You use your extensive knowledge of Swift and iOS to advocate for the adoption of cleaner design patterns or tests that improve the stability of the product.
Long term, you’ll improve your ability to interface with other teams, write technical design documents, and lead projects from conception to completion.
You will work on regulated medical products that must adhere to the highest quality standards. As a result, you will become a master of your craft, obsessed with delivering code that meets a very high bar and is free of defects.


This Might Be Your Next Career Move IF:


You care about helping make quality mental health care realistically accessible to millions of people nationwide
You have experience implementing Swift programming with Protocol-oriented design.


Role-specific competencies


You have 5+ years of production experience with native iOS app development.
You have experience implementing Swift based iOS apps, knowledge of iOS SDKs, and a strong grasp of modern iOS development best practices.
You have a rich understanding of the technical nuances and trade-offs of the iOS platform, including visual elements, SwiftUI, security, and privacy.
You've worked on and supported high quality apps in the Apple App Store (ideally 50K+ users)


Our Core Values


Empathic: You’re a compassionate person and a team player motivated to understand others and help them be successful, too. You care as deeply for your colleagues as you do for our mission and our users.
Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you’ve got.
Strong work-ethic: You’ve mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

Because the majority of our codebase is written in Ruby, even in specialized roles, a knowledge of Ruby and Ruby on Rails or a desire to learn and contribute is necessary.

For context, see this merge request with some history on this policy .

Some specialties within GitLab are using primary programming languages other than Ruby. These programming languages are defined as being primary in terms of an engineer's experience and what they'll be writing day to day. The expectation from the specialty is that engineers will have extensive experience in this primary programming language as well as some level of understanding of Ruby and, Ruby on Rails.

At Personio we are on the amazing journey of exponential customer and product growth. After our recent $125M Series D funding we are the most valuable HR tech company in Europe and we are investing heavily in our Technology Platform.




The mission of the Technology Platform tribe is to ensure Personio is built and operated with excellence. We are responsible for ensuring our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and ensuring our engineers have the tools and infrastructure to achieve this. We measure engineering excellence through core metrics of software development delivery. We use these metrics to drive initiatives that enable our peer engineering teams to build, test, deploy, monitor and operate Personio to the highest industry standards.




In the Developer Experience (DX) team, we enable our own developers to build, test and deploy code quickly, easily and reliably on their own. We focus on maximizing engineering effectiveness, by developing and distributing robust and practical development tools, building scalable devops processes, and advocating for software development best practices.

The DX Engineer is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organisation.

Your scope will include everything from how services are developed and tested locally, to how they are built and integration-tested using our Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, to how they are rolled out, run and monitored in our production Kubernetes cluster.
You will foster relationships and work closely with product teams to support them in the migration of our monolith to microservices architecture, understand their challenges and propose result-oriented solutions to improve their productivity.
You will pair with other engineers on the DX team and take ownership on delivering new innovation solutions.

As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

 Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B The company’s valuation has more than tripled since early 2020.
 The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.
 According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

 Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com, and MakeMyTrip.
 The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

By day 60 you are helping translate user needs and requirements into technical solutions, helping write technical specifications, and contributing elegant code that turns needs into reality. 


Create Systems That Help Us Scale

By day 90 you're helping troubleshoot production issues and helping answer questions from other teams as well as helping monitor production systems.
Within your first few months, you are quickly learning, maintaining, and enhancing disparate systems across Woebot.

c6ae2daa324241b8ade157a8aef43a82,"Reddit, Inc.","Staff Backend Engineer, NFT Platform","Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland Remote","Our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. With more than 50 million people visiting 100,000+ communities daily, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. From pets to parenting, skincare to stocks, there’s a community for everybody on Reddit. For more information, visit redditinc.com.

In case you haven’t heard, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the newest, most explosive movement in the world of crypto. With the power of blockchain, it is now possible to truly own digital assets on the internet in a way that wasn’t possible before. Even though excitement over NFTs is only just beginning, sales have already hit $2.5B this year and it can be a bit difficult to explain why.

For many, it’s a way to support their favorite artists, and for others it’s a way to curate impressive collections of ultra-rare collectibles. Just as cryptocurrencies are set to revolutionize the world of economics and finance, NFTs are going to rewrite how we think about digital goods. So while NFTs are currently dominated by digital artwork, NFTs can be minted to represent ownership in any item at all. Beyond visual art, there are already NFTs for music, videos, articles, and even memes. Many believe that NFTs will become the standard for items in online games, as well as items in the eventual metaverse.

For Reddit, it will always be about community. As the “frontpage of the Internet”, Reddit brings over 430 million people together each month through their common interests, inviting them to share, vote, comment, and create across thousands of communities. If there is one thing we’ve noticed with NFTs, they too have an incredible power to create a sense of participation and belonging. With every new NFT project, a vibrant community of owners pops up with it. Fans of today’s biggest creators and brands are now flocking to buy digital goods directly from them -- to support them, to gain exclusive access, and to feel a greater sense of connection with them. Over time, we believe this will only grow, and NFTs will play a central role in how fans support their favorite creators and communities.

Our team is a new and exciting, rapidly growing team that aims to build the largest creator economy on the internet, powered by independent creators, digital goods, and NFTs. We are looking for strong engineers and leaders to help us seed the team, set its strategy, and build for the future. If you ask us, the NFT movement has only just begun, so come and join our team to get started.

Responsibilities

Design, build and ship backend services for millions of users to create, buy, sell and use NFT-backed digital goods.
Move fast while balancing quality. We can’t afford extensive processes, and we also can’t afford show-stopping bugs. We need people who can balance speed with quality while quickly building brand-new products.
Contribute meaningfully to team strategy. We give everyone a seat at the table and encourage active participation in planning for the future. Don’t just come along for the ride.
Communicate effectively, within the team and across disciplines. Work closely with product managers and designers to craft compelling user experiences.


5+ years backend development experience with multiple parts of the backend stack, from databases to networking to efficient computing. We develop with Go, Python, Postgres, Redis, Thrift, GraphQL and deploy to Docker/k8s on AWS.
Ability to design and implement complex distributed systems operating under high load. Experience developing customer-facing public applications is preferred.
Entrepreneurial spirit. On our team, everyone needs to act like a startup CEO. You must be self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You live to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.
Excellent communication skills. You must be able to collaborate effectively with teams in a fully-remote environment, and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences.
Experience with crypto / NFTs / Go is not required! All of us learned along the way, and so can you.


Reddit is continuing to grow our teams with the best talent. We're completely remote friendly and will continue to be after the pandemic. Apply today to learn more!

Do you want to be part of a customer facing technology team helping to ensure the success of Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a leading technology organization?

If you fit the description, you might be the person we are looking for! We are a group of smart people, passionate about cloud computing, and believe that world class support is critical to customer success.

WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A LIFE AT AWS?

Every day will bring new and exciting challenges on the job while you:

Learn and use groundbreaking technologies.
Apply advanced troubleshooting techniques to provide unique solutions to our customers' individual needs.
Interact with leading engineers around the world.
Partner with Amazon Web Services teams to help reproduce and resolve customer issues.
Leverage your extensive customer support experience to provide feedback to internal AWS teams on how to improve our services.
Drive customer communication during critical events.
Drive projects that improve support-related processes and our customers’ technical support experience.
Write tutorials, how-to videos, and other technical articles for the developer community.
Work on critical, highly complex customer problems that may span multiple AWS services.

WHY AWS SUPPORT?

First and foremost this is a customer support role – in The Cloud.
On a typical day, a Support Engineer will be primarily responsible for solving customer’s cases through a variety of customer contact channels which include telephone, email, and web/live chat. You will apply advanced troubleshooting techniques to provide tailored solutions for our customers and drive customer interactions by thoughtfully working with customers to dive deep into the root cause of an issue.
Apart from working on a broad spectrum of technical issues, an AWS Support Engineer may also coach/mentor new hires, develop & present training, partner with development teams on complex issues or contact deflection initiatives, participate in new hiring, write tools/script to help the team, or work with leadership on process improvement and strategic initiatives.
Career development: We promote advancement opportunities across the organization to help you meet your career goals.
Training: We have training programs to help you develop the skills required to be successful in your role.

We hire smart people who are keen to build a career with AWS, so we are more interested in the areas that you do know instead of those you haven’t been exposed to yet.

Support engineers interested in travel have presented training or participated in focused summits across our sites or at specific AWS events.
As we operate on a follow-the-sun model, with Premium Support sites located globally, working hours and days are based on customer demand and may include weekends (on a rotational basis).

The opportunity




As an iOS Developer, you will be a part of an autonomous cross-functional team comprising of developers, a designer, a QA engineer and a product manager developing new features and enhancements in our iOS products.

You are passionate about software development and iOS applications. Swift shouldn't be strange for you.

You create, structure and comment your code, but you know when done is better than perfect and can compromise to deliver on time.

Clean code is important to you. You write code with other developers in mind, working towards neat abstractions and an intuitive interface. You need to be a great team player and communicator, you need to share your knowledge with less experienced teammates and be able to absorb it from our senior developers.

You’re eager to learn, suggest improvements, and have the capacity to implement them – we’re constantly striving to improve things and you strive in such environments. You have an open mind and are able to pick things up quickly.

You have experience collaborating with designers and are capable of converting UI prototypes to functional apps. We would love to see your portfolio with the beautiful apps you developed and contributed to your career.




What good looks like:

2+ years of iOS development experience.
Solid grasp of iOS design principles, patterns and best practices.
Good understanding of asynchronous programming concepts. If you have experience with RxSwift or similar frameworks is a plus.
Experience with Git.
Knowledge about unit testing and architectural design patterns.
Good communication skills
Experience working in a remote team environment
Familiarity with lean and agile methodologies
Familiarity with Sentry or other error monitoring tools.




What you can expect




We are a remote-friendly team, with the option to work out of our Hubs - Cork HQ, Belfast, Boston or fully remotely. At Teamwork, we believe that work is what you do, not where you sit. You will experience a collaborative and flat culture, where titles are less valued than delivering outcomes that impact and move the dial. We want you to have what you need to hit the ground running, so you will get the best kit to help you do your best work from Day 1. We expect our people to work hard, level up and turn up every day focused on being their best for each other and our customers. In return, you can expect to know what success looks like in your role, and have regular check-ins with your manager. In addition, we will work with you to grow your career with Teamwork.

But when all is said and done we want you to have fun and enjoy working with us! We put a lot of effort into having regular social events, a weekly all-staff catch up with quizzes and prizes to be won, and an annual staff gathering Grand Council focused on celebrating the wins, planning for success and building connection & collaboration.

d1d59859ca9c4faba66031326cfcf819,Personio,Senior Backend Engineer (Devops),"Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland","THE ROLE




At Personio we are on the amazing journey of exponential customer and product growth. After our recent $125M Series D funding we are the most valuable HR tech company in Europe and we are investing heavily in our Technology Platform.

The mission of the Technology Platform tribe is to ensure Personio is built and operated with excellence. We are responsible for ensuring our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and ensuring our engineers have the tools and infrastructure to achieve this. We measure engineering excellence through core metrics of software development delivery. We use these metrics to drive initiatives that enable our peer engineering teams to build, test, deploy, monitor and operate Personio to the highest industry standards.

In the Libraries & Frameworks (L&F) team, part of the Developer Experience (DX) space, we engineer, document, distribute and maintain convenient, stable and secure low-level software components that accelerate and simplify the development of Personio applications. We ensure our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and stays up-to-date, secure and performant. Our libraries make it easy for our fellow engineers to do the right thing, while providing guard rails to avoid common mistakes.

The Libraries & Frameworks Engineer is a high-impact, highly technical, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organisation. We support our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, and we play a key role in enabling them to deprecate our monolith and create a highly scalable microservices architecture with modern tech stacks.

Are you interested in maintaining, versioning, documenting, packaging and distributing low-level libraries used internally by dozens of microservices? Do you get excited about guiding, helping and sharing knowledge with fellow developers? Are you eager to abstract away the most common challenges that engineers face to improve the entire department’s productivity? Then this role is for you!




Responsibilities

You will research, design and create new libraries and tools to abstract away the most common engineering problems and tasks and enable developers to quickly and easily create new secure and scalable microservices.
You will be an internal open-source maintainer, actively developing, as well as reviewing and accepting contributions for our low-level software components and tools including libraries, docker base images, microservice templates, linters, etc. Some of these are also open-sourced under our Github organisation.
You will foster relationships and work closely with product teams to support them in the migration of our monolith to microservices architecture, understand their challenges and propose result-oriented solutions to improve their productivity.
You will also spend time teaching engineers (especially new joiners) how to use our libraries and tools, advocate for best development practices by giving internal talks, organising internal onboarding workshops or writing documentation and tutorials.




What you need to succeed

Over 6 years of software engineering experience building and designing web applications and distributed systems. You know what product teams need to create a scalable, event-driven microservice architecture and you understand how to tackle the technical challenges.
You have a track record of building, maintaining and upgrading long-lived libraries and tools (a minimum of over 2 years) with a large community of users, either internal or open-source. You live and breathe backward compatibility, semantic versioning, changelogs, end-user documentation and deprecation warnings.
You intuitively understand what makes a good API. You can empathise with the end user of your tools and you know how to design a delightful, functional and stable interface that makes it easy for developers to do the right thing. 
You have deep expertise with at least one of our tech stacks: Java/Kotlin (JVM, Gradle, SpringBoot), PHP (Laravel) and Golang. In particular you’re comfortable with the respective package and dependency management systems of each. Creating and distributing components through artefact repositories. You are familiar with the intricacies of their respective runtime environment and their most common frameworks.
You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services. You like writing great technical documentation and useful tutorials.
You have excellent written and spoken English (level C1/C2 on the CEFR scale).
We are experiencing rapid growth and are “building our plane while flying it”. So bring your agile mindset to the table!
You embrace feedback - no one is perfect, neither are we. So let’s make this an opportunity to praise and learn from each other.
Finally, you have a good sense of humour. Have fun with us, learn with us from mistakes and bring your good vibes!

ad438340b5e8404d8a42ed93afe0ad1c,"Reddit, Inc.","Senior Backend Engineer, NFT Platform","Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland Remote","Our mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. Reddit is a community of communities where people can dive into anything through experiences built around their interests, hobbies, and passions. With more than 50 million people visiting 100,000+ communities daily, it is home to the most open and authentic conversations on the internet. From pets to parenting, skincare to stocks, there’s a community for everybody on Reddit. For more information, visit redditinc.com.

In case you haven’t heard, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the newest, most explosive movement in the world of crypto. With the power of blockchain, it is now possible to truly own digital assets on the internet in a way that wasn’t possible before. Even though excitement over NFTs is only just beginning, sales have already hit $2.5B this year and it can be a bit difficult to explain why.

For many, it’s a way to support their favorite artists, and for others it’s a way to curate impressive collections of ultra-rare collectibles. Just as cryptocurrencies are set to revolutionize the world of economics and finance, NFTs are going to rewrite how we think about digital goods. So while NFTs are currently dominated by digital artwork, NFTs can be minted to represent ownership in any item at all. Beyond visual art, there are already NFTs for music, videos, articles, and even memes. Many believe that NFTs will become the standard for items in online games, as well as items in the eventual metaverse.

For Reddit, it will always be about community. As the “frontpage of the Internet”, Reddit brings over 430 million people together each month through their common interests, inviting them to share, vote, comment, and create across thousands of communities. If there is one thing we’ve noticed with NFTs, they too have an incredible power to create a sense of participation and belonging. With every new NFT project, a vibrant community of owners pops up with it. Fans of today’s biggest creators and brands are now flocking to buy digital goods directly from them -- to support them, to gain exclusive access, and to feel a greater sense of connection with them. Over time, we believe this will only grow, and NFTs will play a central role in how fans support their favorite creators and communities.

Our team is a new and exciting, rapidly growing team that aims to build the largest creator economy on the internet, powered by independent creators, digital goods, and NFTs. We are looking for strong engineers and leaders to help us seed the team, set its strategy, and build for the future. If you ask us, the NFT movement has only just begun, so come and join our team to get started.

Responsibilities

Design, build and ship backend services for millions of users to create, buy, sell and use NFT-backed digital goods.
Move fast while balancing quality. We can’t afford extensive processes, and we also can’t afford show-stopping bugs. We need people who can balance speed with quality while quickly building brand-new products.
Contribute meaningfully to team strategy. We give everyone a seat at the table and encourage active participation in planning for the future. Don’t just come along for the ride.
Communicate effectively, within the team and across disciplines. Work closely with product managers and designers to craft compelling user experiences.


5+ years backend development experience with multiple parts of the backend stack, from databases to networking to efficient computing. We develop with Go, Python, Postgres, Redis, Thrift, GraphQL and deploy to Docker/k8s on AWS.
Ability to design and implement complex distributed systems operating under high load. Experience developing customer-facing public applications is preferred.
Entrepreneurial spirit. On our team, everyone needs to act like a startup CEO. You must be self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You live to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.
Excellent communication skills. You must be able to collaborate effectively with teams in a fully-remote environment, and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences.
Experience with crypto / NFTs / Go is not required! All of us learned along the way, and so can you.

GET AN IMPRESSION OF THE TEAM

👋 Hi, we are the Polygoons. We are the warden of geometries, shepherds of trips, bringer of the holy throttle, overseer of parking capacity, curators of policies and guardians of the geofence. In short, we are the platform team responsible for geo-data - an impactful team of three engineers and a product manager. Why Polygoons? Well for one, we love the movie ""The Goonies"", and so should you. On the other hand we like to think outside the polygon.

THE ROLE AND YOUR IMPACT AT TIER

As a Software Developer in Platform you will build the solid, foundational and event-driven micro-services that product teams and partners can rely and build their services on while TIER continues to grow with warp-speed.
We design it. We test it. We build it. We ship it. We document it. You own it all. The good, the bad, the ugly and the glory.
Geo is everything, and everything is geo. Try to imagine the amount of (geo) data that 150.000 vehicles produce every second. Then add even more vehicles to that, because we're bigger than that. If you think you have an idea, you're already lying to yourself about it. It's a lot. And it's exciting to work with that. Trust us.
You will coordinate projects with product teams, gather their requirements and implement features. But as a platform team we pride ourselves with ingenuity and openness towards new technologies that help us manage TIER scale. That said, discoveries will be a big part of the job, and it is highly encouraged to keep an open mind.
 YOU’LL FIT GREAT WITH THESE SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS

Ideally, you have 2+ years experience in Nodejs/TypeScript (or any other strongly typed language)
You have first hand experience or you’re interested in building event-driven systems with Apache Kafka
Since we're the geo team, any experience and previous touchpoints with the geospatial world is a huge plus
You understand the importance of building services that scale
We do trunk-based development. You own your code and bring it all the way to production.
Experience with kubernetes and terraform is a plus, but don't you worry as we have an excellent infrastructure teams that rush to your aid if need be.
 THIS MAY INSPIRE YOU

One sunny Barcelona morning, two designers sat down to build a beautiful lead generation form for a bathroom company's showroom. They ended up reimagining the data collection experience, and realised it was one idea they wouldn't flush down the toilet. Today, Typeform is a team of over 400 people from more than 35 countries, with offices in Barcelona, Spain and San Francisco, US.

We're building a world where brands, businesses, and their communities can have more personal relationships with the people who matter most. To do this, we give people the tools they need to have conversational experiences at scale—because meaningful relationships start with conversations.

From online lead forms and engaging quizzes, to face-to-face encounters in the office, help us build more meaningful relationships, one conversation at a time.

About The Team

Typeform is making data collection more conversational. And we're evolving like never before. But we're still young, and you'll get to shape the future of this company—beyond that, the industry.

We're looking for an accomplished and passionate Senior Backend Engineer with 10+ years experience. You'll report to a Director of Engineering or a Senior Engineering Manager.

You'll join us in our transition from monolith to micro-services architecture. As a high-growth organisation, we need an architecture that scales in a big way—by at least 20x, to be exact. Come help us scale and integrate Typeform with other platforms. You'll help us pick up the pace when it comes to delivering value to our users.

Find out more about our Engineering Value Proposition here .

The Role

Here's what you'll do:

Get busy with the end-to-end lifecycle of features, from concept to deployment.
Contribute to technical and architectural decisions.
Work in a motley crew of engineers, designers, product owners.
Grow—use your annual learning budget to take courses and go to conferences. There'll be plenty of other opportunities for advancement, such as mentoring, internal talks and workshops.
Grow others—use your experience to help colleagues achieve their goals.
Give back to the community—take one workday a month to contribute to an open source project of your choice.


About youHere's what we're after:

You're comfortable picking up new stacks and choosing the right tool for the project. Even better, you're comfortable with Go or PHP.
You've got experience working with AWS and Kafka
You take ownership and feel responsible for the product as a whole. You don't mind working on legacy code.
You have educated teams around good coding practices and principles.
You've got experience guiding a team through successful architectural and technical decisions.
You can show us how you made an impact beyond a team or departmental level.
You've got a testing mindset—writing the right kind of test is a given for you.
You understand that quality is down to everybody.
You show maturity in tradeoffs and plan well.


We're now a remote first company so thisjob can be based in our office in Barcelona or as a remote role in Spain. We also recruit remotely in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania and the UK as long as you do not require visa sponsorship. You'll be made to feel at home from the first moment, thanks to our thoughtfully designed remote onboarding. You'll get a €1,000 one-off payment to kit out your home office, plus €120 per month to cover any extra expenses. Other benefits include flexible working hours, a learning and development budget and private health insurance.

Think you're a good fit? Hit apply—success might be just around the corner 😉

 Today, more than 2.5M people from all over the world use Typeform. We celebrate the diversity of our customers , and we want our employees to reflect those differences. At Typeform, we're committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, colour, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender, gender identity or expression, or veteran status.

The Sharding Group is the direct outcome of applying our value of Iteration to the direction of the Database Scalability Working Group . We started with multiple proposals and ideas on increasing database scalability through different sharding implementations. We have targeted Decomposition as the first iteration for scaling our database to accommodate 10 Million Daily Active Users (DAU) of GitLab.com. Over the next several months we will continue to deliver on our Phased Rollout Plan to ship a decomposed database into production by mid 2022. After that we'll move on to similarly ambitious projects related to scaling our database which may involve horizontal sharding and/or a pod-like architecture.

Iterating and improving - Once we get the feedback we need, we iterate and improve;
Taking ownership - The code we ship is our responsibility as we know it best;
Delivering value - By focussing on providing the best customer experience, we improve acquisition and retention and drive revenue.




As our Senior Backend Engineer, you'll be responsible for:




Collaborating with your peers from product, design, and engineering on a cross-functional, outcome-based team to craft and deliver on OKRs
Helping drive your team through large projects autonomously, while continuously assessing and communicating progress and iterating on solutions.
Collaborating and recommending architectural solutions, while understanding and explaining trade-offs around time to market, structural and functional quality, security, maintainability, resources, and scope.

Result-oriented - You manage the trade-offs between speed and quality and are able to find the right balance. You would rather ship, measure, learn and iterate, rather than coding the perfect component on the first try.
Resilient - You can adapt and roll up your sleeves to help others. You operate at a stable pace with visibility most of the time and you are ready to embrace change when it happens.
Communicative - You are able to communicate with your team, stakeholders, and other peers inside Engineering, being able to share ideas, bring different opinions and also give constructive feedback. You are able to translate your thoughts/ideas to technical and non-technical people.

Our internal research shows that Reddit is part of our users’ Path to Purchase. People come to Reddit to research products, read reviews, and make decisions about what to buy. We want to let advertisers showcase their products directly within these conversations.

The Product Catalogs team will build features and infrastructure to ingest, store, and manage our Advertisers’ products. The team will operate at high scale, needing to eventually support hundreds of millions of products from thousands of advertisers. These products can change on a daily or even hourly basis. The team will also need a strong customer focus as we devise new ways to bring products into Reddit’s system (CSV upload, data feed, Shopify, etc).

Backed by the world-class Bessemer Venture Partners, we have grown from a bootstrapped company of a few to the market leader in our category. We attribute our success to our belief that the people are the most important part of a business and our commitment to being a fantastic place to work.




As a Senior Backend Engineer with Beyond, you will have the opportunity to build the next evolution of our SaaS-based product as well as work on new products. Because you will be working with a successful team that is completely remote, excellent coding and communication skills are key. This is a great opportunity for someone to work closely with the entire product life cycle from concept to go-to-market! If you enjoy rolling up your sleeves and jumping in, then read on!




Beyond's Engineering team believes in:




Reducing scope - The best way to control progress and test hypotheses is to prevent scope creep;
Shipping early - The best way to learn early is to ship early. No need to be perfect;
Iterating and improving - Once we get the feedback we need, we iterate and improve;
Taking ownership - The code we ship is our responsibility as we know it best;
Delivering value - By focussing on providing the best customer experience, we improve acquisition and retention and drive revenue.




As our Senior Backend Engineer, you'll be responsible for:




Collaborating with your peers from product, design, and engineering on a cross-functional, outcome-based team to craft and deliver on OKRs
Helping drive your team through large projects autonomously, while continuously assessing and communicating progress and iterating on solutions.
Collaborating and recommending architectural solutions, while understanding and explaining trade-offs around time to market, structural and functional quality, security, maintainability, resources, and scope.

Collaborative - You enjoy exploring and committing as a team, you welcome others' ideas, and you value teamwork and team decision-making over being right and having things going your way.

Thrive is a leading behavior change B2B SaaS company founded by Arianna Huffington in 2016 with the mission to end the stress and burnout epidemic. Thrive helps individuals and organizations improve well-being, performance, and mental resilience with its AI-powered behavior change technology platform. Thrive's Microsteps — small, science-backed steps to improve health and productivity — have been adopted by employees at more than 125 organizations in over 140 countries. We're leading the global conversation around well-being and performance, developing products and programs that help people go from knowing what to do to actually doing it.

Thrive is Dublin's newest startup! We recently completed our $80 Million Series C fundraising round. In conjunction with our HQ in New York we are supercharging the team that powers our entire API platform, which is 100% built and owned in Dublin. Our APIs are GraphQL based and powered by Kotlin/Kubernetes under the hood.

This role is open to Senior Engineers and above, Staff / Principal variants exist for the right candidates.

Who You Are:

An excellent communicator who delights in writing technical documents and knows in their heart of hearts that they're probably more valuable than the software itself
Embarrassed by test code coverage results that are less than 100%, but willing to accept that the Pareto principle still applies
Opinionated about the garbage collection algorithms (and willing to say so)
Someone who loves dynamic typing
Someone who never saw a code path that you didn't apply the security squint to
The sort to learn a new programming language about once a year just to see how it feels
Able to build lean, clean system design


How You'll Contribute:

Build sensible and clean services that implement new product features in ways that both scale with our user base, and also with our engineering growth (no hacks)
Work closely with our product and design teams to flesh out the minimal possible version of a feature and iterate quickly 
Pair with our delightful SREs to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot systems
Work on our identity platform
Build internal tools to help our account executives delight our customers
Improve our video streaming systems, track tail latencies, and more
Take part in peer reviews, collaborative design sessions, production issue troubleshooting, business requirement gathering and other organisational processes


Must Haves:

Five or more years of professional software engineering experience
Kotlin would be amazing, but at least an OOP language such as Java or C# || FP languages such as Scala or Clojure or F#). Fun fact: Kotlin doesn't have a ternary
If you're more of a Python/Ruby/Go/TypeScript aficionado, let's talk 
Dashing, elegant, and graceful expertise in the tools of our trade (i.e. git, Docker, Postman, build systems, IDEs, etc.)
The ability to name six different HTTP methods faster than you can Google them, and talk about a time they didn't do what they were supposed to
Hard-won experience on the benefits and drawbacks of stateless systems, and how to push back against state creeping in
An insightful explanation for the difference between computer science and software engineering
Knowledge of how to build and maintain a unit test suite
SELECT tech FROM experience WHERE tech IN ('Postgres', 'MySQL'); -- we use PG
Able to build REST/Open APIs in your sleep, but think that GraphQL is the future


What We Offer:

Incredible potential for professional growth, and influence over our growth strategy
As much responsibility as you can handle
A human-centric culture with a range of wellness perks and benefits
A competitive compensation package
Health, dental, and optical insurance
Pension plan with company matching
Generous paid time-off
Being part of a mission-driven company that's truly making a difference people's lives


Our Mission:

Thrive's mission is to end the stress and burnout epidemic by offering companies and individuals sustainable, science-based solutions to enhance well-being, performance, and purpose and create a healthier relationship with technology. Recent science has shown that the pervasive belief that burnout is the price we must pay for success is a delusion. We know, instead, that when we prioritize our well-being, our decision-making, creativity, and productivity improve dramatically. Thrive is committed to accelerating the culture shift that allows people to reclaim their lives and move from merely surviving to thriving."

With solutions in Enterprise Search, Observability, and Security, we help improve customer and employee search experiences, keep critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats. Elastic enables organizations worldwide to use the power of Elastic, including Netflix, Uber, BBC, Microsoft, and thousands of others.

Elastic was built on a foundation of being free and open, which trickles down to how we work. We’re a distributed organization and have been from the beginning. Being distributed isn’t just a way of doing business—it’s a mentality that is at the core of our culture.

This is You!




The following are some areas you should have experience in - don’t worry if you don’t have them all (nobody does!) as long as you can show you are interested in learning and able to demonstrate what you know and don’t know.

You are enthusiastic about creating innovative solutions to customer problems. You should see different technologies as a means to an end and be excited by the idea of hunting for a solution through unfamiliar domains.
You are an effective coach/mentor for moe junior software engineers that will join as the team expands. Collaboration with, and empathy for, both our team and our customers are invaluable in how we work.
You are comfortable with an environment where things move quickly. As an early stage startup we’re still putting together all of the processes and supports of larger, more mature companies - your input will help us shape them.
You are comfortable challenging architectural or coding opinions in the team.




If any of the below are also you, then that's a bonus!

Experience delivering and running SaaS applications in production.
Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

Will identify areas of improvement in how we work, and in the codebase, and share the responsibility of making our Engineering team even better.
Own the problems you’re solving - and the software you write to solve them - all the way to production and beyond, reacting to customer feedback to improve those solutions.
Will help mentor and grow junior team members as the team expands.



This role is about more than writing code. As an early team member, you will:

Have our support to become an influential voice in shaping our product, our technical direction and how we work. 
Use your understanding of the possibilities of software and automation to influence a product that brings power to our customers’ engineering and security teams. 
Use your skills to ship exciting new features while enhancing our scalability, security and availability.

(1hr) A video call chat session to meet a few other team members from engineering or leadership to allow both sides to meet future teammates.
