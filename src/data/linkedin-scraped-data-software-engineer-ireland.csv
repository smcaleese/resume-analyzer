In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Risk Engineering works to protect Block and our customers from fraud and payment disputes. We keep our customers safe while €20B+ flows through Block annually, and we allow the entire company to take risks and grow. To do this, we build systems to detect and respond to potential fraud threats, provide outstanding tools to agents for investigating fraud events, and give our customers seamless web and mobile experiences to manage and fight payment disputes. Our mission is to protect Block, protect our customers, and make a complicated and sometimes painful process understandable to all.

This is an exciting time for Block as we have recently launched within the Irish market as part of our plans to continue growing our merchant network globally. We’re now looking for a graduate engineer to join our new Risk team in Dublin, Ireland. In this role, you’d be among the first engineers joining the company in Dublin, establishing a team that is committed to keeping our customers safe from fraud and mitigating the impact of financial loss. You’d work closely with other engineering teams, as well as our Risk Operations and Policy team here in Dublin, and you’d work cross-functionally on a global scale to strategize on and deliver the product roadmap. As part of this growth we need to ensure that our protection scales to meet this new demand.

The Emerging Talent team at Block hires engineers of all shapes and sizes, who are excited about building world-class software and solving hard problems. Our challenges span many technologies, from web to server-side development (Java, Go and/or Ruby). Our engineers work on small teams with people across engineering, product, and creative, building reliable, fast, responsive, and beautiful software.


Ensure Block works right, every time, by using testing, continuous integration, and in-depth code reviews (Reliability)
Create interactions and APIs that promote trust, increase security, and make it harder to do the wrong thing (Security)
Collect all the data around every transaction and turn it into tools that help our users (Analytics)
Envision entire new products, features, and flows that are inspired, considered, and magical (Products)
Make quick decisions on millions of dollars which requires diligence and passion for detecting bad actors and preventing loss (Fraud Prevention)

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability requires building control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle many types of failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate various geographical distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases, multiple database engines (RDS supports MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora), and a wide variety of customer workloads.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

Esports Technologies operate a licensed online gambling platform, gogawi.com that offers real money betting on esports events and professional sports from around the world in a secure environment.

At Esports Technologies, we are at an exciting rapid growth phase, expanding our business across multiple markets and service offerings and developing our Centres of Excellence (CoE) across Malta as our Marketing CoE, Dublin Ireland and USA our Technology CoE’s.

EST is a public Limited company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange (EBET).

About the role:

“Esports Technologies” is looking for a backend software engineer. We have a huge appetite for growth and need more developers to expedite things. The new developers could specialize in the following areas:

· Vendor integrations. Take data from a source, convert into a (evolving) internal format and reliably pass into a message bus from where it could be consumed by multiple internal systems.

· Provide some game-related data (schedule, team roster, etc...) to our customer-facing system or directly to a front-end.

These are the short-term areas. Eventually you may transit into development of more critical systems such as modelling and risk management.

We Expect That

· In one month you’ll get accustomed to our internal systems and components and create a scaffolding for the application in question (integration or data source)

· In three months you’ll work with vendors and stakeholders and implement the most valuable features. The application will be in production with the applicable non-functional quality features (reliability, scaling).

· In six months the original app will be finalized and won’t require much additional work. You will likely switch to another application (in the same or different domain)

Role Requirements and Responsibilities:

Simply stated – you can create quality services. The services you’ll be (initially) developing are small in functionality and size, but these should be of high technical quality. To do that we expect that:

· You know well at least one programming language and related tools. We use Python, Scala and Java so knowledge of these (and corresponding libraries) will be good. You don’t have to have a huge amount of experience but should be familiar with common tasks like calling external service over HTTP and storing data in some persistent database.

· You can communicate with a team lead and take direction.

· You can adapt and learn quickly. The services you will be building are small and there are no dedicated roles in our teams. You will work on multiple parts on the backend.

· You should be familiar with operational aspects like quality management (usually testing), monitoring and alerting. We’ll help you to onboard with the tools we use if needed and provide suggestions and ideas during development.

Travel requirements between EU/USA may be required time to time with this role.

Must have:

· 3+ years working in a Software engineer role.

· Business process and structure experience to create solid project frameworks for success.

· Clear and engaging communication skills.

· Ability to work within teams locally and virtually.

Nice-to-have (but not required):

· Understanding of distributed systems.

· Passion for code and application quality.

· Willing to take risks, fail fast and iterate quickly.

· Experience with integrating (consuming or producing data for) third-party vendors.

Here we welcome and enjoy a positive diverse working environment with every individual working as part of one team to achieve great things together. With our cutting-edge technology we strive to be Best-In-Class in our industry, to our employees and customers.

Familiarity with UI automation frameworks, tools, and techniques to validate user interfaces (mobile, portal, web, etc.)
Able to mentor peers and guide less experienced Team members


COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

The RDS team is the largest cloud database business in the world, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are automated by our control systems. Providing simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovation in our system to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale.

RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability require control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate global distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases and a wide variety of customer workloads. Also, we know how to have a good time as a team, we celebrate our successes, have team building events and celebrate birthdays and other life events.

As a part of a close-knit team of engineers that are agile, data driven, and highly collaborative, you will work with a wide variety of cutting edge technology to automate enterprise level databases with high reliability at massive scale. You will have the opportunity to propose ideas that positively impact our customers, owning major deliverables end-to-end, while working closely with experienced engineers and teams to execute on them.

We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

*Work/Life Balance*

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one day a month. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause and prioritize fixes to reduce operational load on team.

*Mentorship & Career Growth*

Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

If you'd like to be a part of creating always-on databases in the AWS cloud, this is the job for you!

The AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is one of the largest cloud database businesses, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are handled in an automated fashion by our control systems. Providing such simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage across multiple datacenters world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovations in our systems in order to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale.

Our Tech Stack

Toast’s products run on a stack that ranges from guest and restaurant-facing Android tablets to backend services in Java to internal, guest-facing and restaurant-facing web apps. Our backend services follow a microservice architecture written using Java 8 and DropWizard; we use AWS extensively, ranging from S3 to RDS to Lambda. We have our own platform for dealing with user management, service elevations and robust load balancing. Toast stores data in a set of sharded Postgres databases and utilizes Apache Spark for large scale data workloads including query and batch processing. The front-end is built primarily using React and ES6. The main Toast POS application is an Android application written in Java and Kotlin. For data between tablets and our cloud platform we operate RabbitMQ clusters as well as direct tablet communication to the back end.

Bread puns encouraged but not required

We are Toasters

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is Baked into our Recipe for Success.

At Toast our employees are our secret ingredient. When they are powered to succeed, Toast succeeds.

The restaurant industry is one of the most diverse industries. We embrace and are excited by this diversity, believing that only through authenticity, inclusivity, high standards of respect and trust, and leading with humility will we be able to achieve our goals.

Baking inclusive principles into our company and diversity into our design provides equitable opportunities for all and enhances our ability to be first in class in all aspects of our industry.

RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability requires building control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle many types of failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate various geographical distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases, multiple database engines (RDS supports MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora), and a wide variety of customer workloads.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team.

Etsy, Inc.'s 'house of brands' portfolio has expanded to now include four individually distinct ecommerce brands – Etsy, fashion resale marketplace Depop, musical instrument marketplace Reverb, and Brazil-based handmade goods marketplace Elo7. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.

About The Team

Job Description

Etsy is seeking a Senior Software Engineer to join our International Experience team. We’re a multi-functional group of engineering, product management, design, research, and analytics.

Our team has two primary responsibilities. First, ensuring that key product development infrastructure is properly localised such as our internal taxonomy, locale management, formatting libraries, etc. Second, that all products & marketing tools are integrated into our human translation systems, ensuring that Etsy fluently speaks to every buyer and seller in their chosen language.

Here’s a taste of the problems we’re solving:

How can we ensure that every Etsy product developer can reach a global audience in their language and with their cultural expectations?
How can we reduce developer friction in our localisation deployment processes?

With your expertise, we will develop libraries and systems used by hundreds of Etsy engineers, and further improve our existing systems. We've written about some of our work, such as our address and currency formatting libraries.

This is a full-time role located in our Dublin office (not a remote position).

About The Role

Contribute at all levels of our web application stack, ranging from front-end web interfaces (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React) to back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL, BigQuery). We do not expect you to have complete expertise of our stack before you join us; we all learn on the job.
Provide detailed and constructive design and code reviews.
Work cross-functionally with various engineering teams.
Gain insights through research, data analysis, and our A/B tests.
Push code to production early and often using our continuous deployment systems.
Continuously learn from your teammates and share your own insights with them.
Empathy, communication, and technical skill are valued equally.

About You

Qualifications

You have experience working on a large scale, high performance and fault-tolerant systems.
You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify.
You care as much about building phenomenal products as you do writing great code.
You have a “leave it better than you found it” mentality, and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write.
Have a knack for organization and breaking down large problems into smaller ones.
Can be autonomous and a fast learner.
You are a mindful, transparent, and communicative member of your team.
Can spin yarns about how you've done this right and wrong at your previous job(s). And we'll give bonus points if you can actually spin yarn.
Enjoy learning about and interacting with the people who use your product.

Additional Information

What's Next

If you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you've hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don't want you to be like everyone else -- we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you're all about.

Our Promise

We encourage people from all backgrounds, ages, abilities, and experiences to apply. Etsy is an equal opportunity employer.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools to accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.
Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling hundreds of millions of API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.
We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.
We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.
We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.
We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).
We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.
In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

CloudWatch values work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Dublin office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later.

On-Call Responsibility

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Energizing and Interesting Technical Problems

CloudWatch is one of the largest real time data platforms in the world, processing more than 1 quadrillion metric observations per month! This requires teams in CloudWatch to innovate at an unprecedented scale. In CloudWatch we love giving customers what they want: high quality, highly usable, highly available services. It’s humbling and energizing to work with excellent, dedicated engineers to build and deliver world-leading service monitoring solutions at AWS scale.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team has a broad mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Inclusive Team Culture

Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Yes we do get to build a really cool service, but we also think a big reason for that is the inclusive and welcoming culture we try to cultivate every day.

We’re looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with a diverse team of peers; someone who will help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we’ve been building.



 3+ years of non-internship professional software development experience
 Proficiency in, at least, one modern programming language such as C, C++, C#, Java, or Perl, including object-oriented design
 Experience taking a leading role in building complex software systems that have been successfully delivered to customers
 Able to work in a diverse team

COVID-19 Considerations

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Have a knack for organization and breaking down large problems into smaller ones.
Can be autonomous and a fast learner.

Job Category Products and Technology Job Details

Build the infrastructure powering work.

Our Team

Slack's Datastores team builds and operates the database platform powering Slack. We write software to manage thousands of stateful hosts, providing several petabytes of online database capacity. We are building one of the fastest-growing database platforms in the world. Our MySQL databases run in Vitess. You can read more about our migration to Vitess in our article Scaling Datastores at Slack with Vitess here: https://slack.engineering/scaling-datastores-at-slack-with-vitess/

Background

Slack enables people all over the world to communicate and collaborate together. Teams of all scales from the worlds largest public companies to the smallest of startups use Slack to get work done, so we take performance and reliability very seriously. A taste of our scale:


The average user spends over 10 hours connected and 2.5 hours active in Slack every single day
1.5 billion+ messages are sent per month, half of those outside the United States
Every day we see over 10M+ daily active users, over a billion web requests, and 10s of billions of database queries.


For millions of people, Slack is the primary communication tool they use at work all day long. They expect it to be exceptionally reliable and fast, all the time.

Infrastructure at Slack

We operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second. Our team maintains and builds the lower levels of our stack, including:


Edge services
Data Stores and Caches
Real-time messaging
Asynchronous background job processing


We know we've done our job correctly when none of our users think about us.We don't typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are incredibly performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, Slack just works seamlessly.Slack's API and web backend is built on PHP/Hack, our backend services are written in Java and Go, and we use Vitess as our storage engine. Our architecture is constantly evolving to handle millions more users. You can read about how we scaled our datastores with Vitess, how we respond to incidents, and much more on our blog.

If you were to join Slack, here the types of things you would do over the course of a typical week:


Operate and enhance our large, highly-available database infrastructure, utilizing technologies such as MySQL and Vitess.
Develop tools to enable self-service and self-managing capabilities of our database infrastructure so that other teams can operate full-stack while rapidly building new features for our customers.
Collaborate with engineering teams on their database storage needs, and advise them throughout the development lifecycle.
Write code to capture database performance, and create tools and dashboards to provide actionable insight into that data.
Participate in our on-call rotation and collaborate with our operations team to triage and resolve production issues.
Support FedRAMP and DoD SRG activities.


You may be a fit for this role if you:


Have been working in Database, Site Reliability Engineering, or infrastructure-owning teams with increasing responsibilities for 3+ years.
Have professional experience using Python, Ruby, Go, or Java
Operated at least one distributed data storage system, at scale and in a team environment. Some examples include: a relational database like MySQL, a search engine like Solr, or a streaming message bus like Kafka.
Deployed server software on Linux, and then operated it at scale. You've debugged its problems, and analyzed and optimized its performance.
Are familiar with deployment automation/configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, or Terraform.
Have experience operating cloud infrastructure, especially AWS.
Are a very strong communicator. You're excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with different audiences.
Write code that can be easily understood by others with an eye towards clarity and maintainability.
Are curious how things work; when they break you are eager and able to help fix them.


Infrastructure is a diverse and inclusive team that treats their colleagues exceptionally well. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each others growth and thus its not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas.Come join us!

Come and build the future with us as we change the way the world sees the Cloud!

CloudWatch is a monitoring service built for developers, system operators, site reliability engineers (SRE), and IT managers. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing a unified view of AWS resources, applications and services that run on AWS, and on-premises servers. Customers use CloudWatch to set high resolution alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to optimize their applications, and ensure they are running smoothly. The CloudWatch team in Dublin is growing and we are looking for exceptional software development engineers to create the next generation CloudWatch experience.

Work/Life Balance

CloudWatch values work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Dublin office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later.

On-Call Responsibility

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Energizing and Interesting Technical Problems

CloudWatch is one of the largest real time data platforms in the world, processing more than 1 quadrillion metric observations per month! This requires teams in CloudWatch to innovate at an unprecedented scale. In CloudWatch we love giving customers what they want: high quality, highly usable, highly available services. It’s humbling and energizing to work with excellent, dedicated engineers to build and deliver world-leading service monitoring solutions at AWS scale.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team has a broad mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Inclusive Team Culture

Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Yes we do get to build a really cool service, but we also think a big reason for that is the inclusive and welcoming culture we try to cultivate every day.

We’re looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with a diverse team of peers; someone who will help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we’ve been building.


Basic Qualifications

3+ years of non-internship professional software development experience
Proficiency in, at least, one modern programming language such as C, C++, C#, Java, or Perl, including object-oriented design
Experience taking a leading role in building complex software systems that have been successfully delivered to customers
Able to work in a diverse team

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

Job Category Products and Technology Job Details

Build the infrastructure powering work.

Our Team

Slack's Datastores team builds and operates the database platform powering Slack. We write software to manage thousands of stateful hosts, providing several petabytes of online database capacity. We are building one of the fastest-growing database platforms in the world. Our MySQL databases run in Vitess. You can read more about our migration to Vitess in our article Scaling Datastores at Slack with Vitess here: https://slack.engineering/scaling-datastores-at-slack-with-vitess/

Background

Slack enables people all over the world to communicate and collaborate together. Teams of all scales from the worlds largest public companies to the smallest of startups use Slack to get work done, so we take performance and reliability very seriously. A taste of our scale:


The average user spends over 10 hours connected and 2.5 hours active in Slack every single day
1.5 billion+ messages are sent per month, half of those outside the United States
Every day we see over 10M+ daily active users, over a billion web requests, and 10s of billions of database queries.


For millions of people, Slack is the primary communication tool they use at work all day long. They expect it to be exceptionally reliable and fast, all the time.

Infrastructure at Slack

We operate at tremendous scale with systems that process millions of events per second. Our team maintains and builds the lower levels of our stack, including:


Edge services
Data Stores and Caches
Real-time messaging
Asynchronous background job processing


We know we've done our job correctly when none of our users think about us.We don't typically ship new user-facing features, but rather ensure our systems are incredibly performant, highly available, reliable, and scalable. In other words, Slack just works seamlessly.Slack's API and web backend is built on PHP/Hack, our backend services are written in Java and Go, and we use Vitess as our storage engine. Our architecture is constantly evolving to handle millions more users. You can read about how we scaled our datastores with Vitess, how we respond to incidents, and much more on our blog.

If you were to join Slack, here the types of things you would do over the course of a typical week:


Operate and enhance our large, highly-available database infrastructure, utilizing technologies such as MySQL and Vitess.
Develop tools to enable self-service and self-managing capabilities of our database infrastructure so that other teams can operate full-stack while rapidly building new features for our customers.
Collaborate with engineering teams on their database storage needs, and advise them throughout the development lifecycle.
Write code to capture database performance, and create tools and dashboards to provide actionable insight into that data.
Participate in our on-call rotation and collaborate with our operations team to triage and resolve production issues.
Support FedRAMP and DoD SRG activities.


You may be a fit for this role if you:


Have been working in Database, Site Reliability Engineering, or infrastructure-owning teams with increasing responsibilities for 3+ years.
Have professional experience using Python, Ruby, Go, or Java
Operated at least one distributed data storage system, at scale and in a team environment. Some examples include: a relational database like MySQL, a search engine like Solr, or a streaming message bus like Kafka.
Deployed server software on Linux, and then operated it at scale. You've debugged its problems, and analyzed and optimized its performance.
Are familiar with deployment automation/configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, or Terraform.
Have experience operating cloud infrastructure, especially AWS.
Are a very strong communicator. You're excited to explain complex technical concepts and share your knowledge with different audiences.
Write code that can be easily understood by others with an eye towards clarity and maintainability.
Are curious how things work; when they break you are eager and able to help fix them.


Infrastructure is a diverse and inclusive team that treats their colleagues exceptionally well. We are happy to help you learn what you need to know; we encourage and support each others growth and thus its not expected that you would have expertise across all of these areas.Come join us!

DESCRIPTION

The Corretto organisation is looking for senior engineers to join a fast growing team that are launching a new metacircular Java runtime. This new runtime is being used to transform and accelerate hyper-scale workloads across multiple CPU architectures. As part of the team - candidates will design and develop sophisticated metacircular features, including instrumentation and recompilation capabilities. Candidates will contribute to performance optimization and compliance with industry standard JVM specifications.

We are looking for people who have a desire to innovate in the Java runtime, including some native development at the C/C++ level. A strong experience with OpenJDK is essential. Understanding of the changes between major Java releases is valuable. Candidates are expected to demonstrate a high level of competency in both development and knowledge of Java's features and inner workings.

Responsibilities will include contributing to the design of future runtime features, and working with teams and services inside AWS to solve their business challenges using this new Java runtime. Existing deployments of our product must be supported on an on-going basis, and the team will need to address any critical issues in live deployments and debug potential functional/performance regressions. The team has a strong culture of collaboration and co-operation, we are looking for people that work well as part of a team and can also work with customers both inside and outside AWS.

About Amazon Corretto

Amazon Corretto is Amazon’s distribution of OpenJDK, used to run our thousands of Java services and also deployed by many AWS customers. The Corretto team is focused on improving OpenJDK for all Java users by focusing on performance, particularly on ARM64 as used by AWS’ Graviton range of processors, and features like the Generational Shenandoah garbage collector. We work with the community to help maintain the Long-Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK as well as contribute to the bleeding edge. We are looking to expand the Corretto team to participate even more in the community and contribute to the long-term success of OpenJDK as a platform.

While Corretto is a relative newcomer to the scene, our team is composed of OpenJDK Authors, Committers, and Reviewers, some with decades of experience in JDK, languages, compilers, and managed runtimes. We learn about where to invest in OpenJDK from running some of the world’s largest Java services. We are firm believers in Open Source and are looking for like-minded people who are interested in working in the open with the community.

EVEN IF YOU ONLY MEET SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS, OR BELIEVE YOU AREN’T EXPERIENCED ENOUGH, WE ARE STILL INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM YOU. We believe that a solid technical foundation and a strong interest in the subject matter can make you successful on the team and we have the opportunities to help you learn and grow in this space. Knowledge and experience in related technologies are generally applicable and valuable.

Java is used for the majority of services in Amazon and nearly all public-facing AWS services. Because of this, we have a vested interest in running the best-possible JDK in areas like security and performance. In 2018, the AWS JDK team migrated Amazon's default JDK to OpenJDK. In order to do this we built rigorous security and quality mechanisms around OpenJDK. We are now able to apply security and Amazon custom patches to the internal OpenJDK as soon as they're available. In early 2019, we took this work public and launched Amazon Corretto, our distribution of OpenJDK. With Corretto, we make our work on OpenJDK available to our customers and the OpenJDK community at large.

About AWS Platform

Whether its Identity features such as access management and sign on, cryptography, console, builder & developer tools, and even projects like automating all of our contractual billing systems, AWS Platform is always innovating with the customer in mind. The AWS Platform team sustains over 750 million transactions per second.

Mentor

We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level etc. Your manager can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work-Life Balance

We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal life.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. Because of that we’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and talent. Our culture was purpose-built to be remote first, and we offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. If you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology with a team that makes a difference every day, let’s talk.

About The Role

CrowdStrike's Sensor and Language Tooling (SaLT) team is hiring a senior engineer to work on the detection platform for our Falcon sensor. The SaLT team is a group of developers working together on C++, compilers and core security logic. This role focuses on runtime capabilities, and will work closely with the people who expose those capabilities in domain-specific languages and use those languages to build security products.

CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.

The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.

CrowdStrike is a computer security company, but we do not expect candidates for this role to have prior security industry experience. We will mentor and train in security topics as needed. We do expect a strong interest in CrowdStrike's mission and a willingness to grow.

Responsibilities

Understand, modify and ultimately assume shared ownership of complex and critical sensor event and detection pipeline logic - for the purposes of expanding and maintaining the systems as well as guiding future direction
Work with the authors of our internal languages to develop safe and flexible programming models for the sensor runtime
Support development teams in designing and building software with cross-platform deliverables (Windows, Mac, Linux)
Mentor junior engineers
Lead major technology initiatives spanning multiple calendar quarters and involving collaboration across teams and product groups

Qualifications

Ability to take ownership of major components of our sensor detections platform, which execute on our sensor runtime in both kernel and user space
Experience with system level programming in C / C++ on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
Proficiency with platform-appropriate development and debugging tools.
Ability to write code with both high performance requirements and reliability requirements
Experience designing and implementing strong automated test coverage
Can work effectively on a geographically distributed team

Desirable Experience

While not required for this position, we will find any of the following particularly attractive in a candidate:

Strong endpoint security background
Fluency in Python
Experience debugging in a kernel or firmware environment.
Strong background in scalable, light-weight and highly performing systems
Experience with asynchronous event processing and/or message passing architectures
Interest in DSLs and custom languages

Benefits Of Working At CrowdStrike

Remote-friendly culture
Market leader in compensation and equity awards
Wellness programs
A variety of professional development and mentorship opportunities
Open offices have stocked kitchens, coffee, soda and treats
Inclusive culture focused on people, customers and innovation

We are committed to building an inclusive culture of belonging that not only embraces the diversity of our people but also reflects the diversity of the communities in which we work and the customers we serve. We know that the happiest and highest performing teams include people with diverse perspectives that encourage new ways of solving problems, so we strive to attract and develop talent from all backgrounds and create workplaces where everyone feels seen, heard and empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work.

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

0ec6777063a84a78b14e3e42643e1832,Woebot Health,Android Engineer,Ireland Remote,"Our mission is to make the best mental health tools radically accessible to everyone.




U.S. Remote or Ireland




We’re a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University. Our Chairman is Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky is a member of our advisory board, both globally recognized leaders in AI/NLP.




We are poised to redefine how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that’s excited about getting us there. You will be working with modern tech such as Kotlin, Architecture Components and Jetpack libraries. Your ability to add new and critical features to Woebot while also refactoring parts of our current system will help provide the fuel that will help us get there.




How You’ll Thrive




Ramping Up

Within your first 30 days: You will learn the major components of Woebot’s codebase, be able to fix minor bugs, and be proficient with our development, build, and release process. 
Equally important, you will build relationships with other engineers, as well as design, product, and clinical teams.




Solve Problems That Matter 

By day 60 you will begin to develop an understanding of the product and codebase, including UI, API calls, and app architecture. 
You’ve delivered at least one large feature or several smaller features with high quality and minimal bugs. Examples below: 
You might add screens that allow our users to reflect back on some of the thoughts they have shared with Woebot 
You might add an accessibility feature like talk back in order to allow Woebot to help a more diverse group of users.
You’re developing features that help change our users’ lives. To achieve this, you’re: 
Writing clean code that you have manually tested.
Creating automated tests to ensure features don’t break in the future. 
Giving and receiving feedback with other engineers and having a humble growth mindset. 




Become A Key Member Of The Mobile Team

By day 90 you'll be able to work with a senior Android engineer on feature feasibility and help estimate story points for more complex features. 
We work in small teams and value everyone’s opinion. You’ll work directly with product managers, user interaction designers, and graphic designers to provide technical feedback that will help us create the best product for our users.
You'll also write clear story descriptions, craft detailed Github Pull Requests, and leave code better than you found it.




Your Growth Opportunity 

Beyond Day 90 you will work diligently to advance our mobile app, delivering on time and with great quality. You’ll be an advocate for implementing native Android features that align with upcoming Android SDKs.
You will learn to architect solutions for new features, increasingly building the skills needed for a senior Android Engineer role.
Long term, you’ll improve your ability to interface with other teams, write technical design documents, and learn to lead projects from conception to completion.
You will work on regulated medical products that must adhere to the highest quality standards. As a result, you will become a master of your craft, obsessed with delivering code that meets a very high bar and is free of defects.




Role-specific competencies

You have 2-3 years of production experience with native Android app development
You have experience implementing Kotlin based Android apps, knowledge of Android SDKs, and a strong grasp of modern Android development best practices.
You have a rich understanding of the technical nuances and trade-offs of the Android platform, including visual elements, security, and privacy.
You've worked on and supported high quality Apps in the Google Play Store (ideally 20K+ users)




Our Core Values

 

Empathic: You’re a compassionate person and a team player motivated to understand others and help them be successful, too. You care as deeply for your colleagues as you do for our mission and our users.
Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you’ve got.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

Every day, millions of people seek answers and share their knowledge through Quora. To foster this marketplace of knowledge, we need to build systems that make sharing knowledge rewarding and discovering it easy; that show you answers to questions you didn't know you had, on topics you didn't know you liked, and that scale to support the participation of the entire planet.

The Product Engineering teams focus on growth, engagement, and activation. This work includes how we distribute content to the right people, how we curate content on Quora and scale all things related to questions, and how we engage new users, writers, and readers. This also includes defining, shaping, and changing the fundamental dynamics of Quora, to create a compelling and cohesive experience for users to share and grow knowledge.

DESCRIPTION

Come join our creative team of software developers dedicated to the Lambda’s Execution Environment and its customers.

Our Team owns the Lambda Execution Environment responsible for the execution of Customer functions. Our Service handles a significant load of Internet traffic generated by internal and external customers that build their services on Lambda. We continue to support and extend this platform to delight our customers and accelerate our business agility. On any given day we use Go, Java, Python, Rust as well as various Native AWS services and Amazon-internal tools. We don't expect you to be an expert in, or know all these technologies listed, but we do expect you to be excited to learn about them. As an experienced engineer in this team, you will play a committed role in developing high quality software designs & solutions to our often complex problems.

This position involves working with Systems (Operating System, Filesystems, Containers, Runtimes, etc) solving lower-level kernel and user-space challenges as well higher-level problems such as API interfaces with our Customers and involves on-call responsibilities. This is typically once every 6 weeks. We don’t like to be paged during the middle of the night and we work relentlessly to keep this down and ensure our systems are fault tolerant.

Our team is dedicated in supporting new team members with a welcoming inclusive approach. We are a seven-person team of mostly mid level engineers and strive to grow each other in career through mentoring. Our team invent, design and build software that is stable and performant. We write and support code that is easy to understand with solutions that are pragmatic. We do this by keeping a high bar in code reviews that we take seriously. We believe good code reviews raise quality and a mechanism to instil high standards for growth.

We care about career growth. We follow a DevOps model and we try and assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a more well rounded engineer that will enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future. As an Amazonian, you’ll enjoy interacting with some of the most talented engineers in our industry through breakfast talks and demos, internal communities and extensive training material that span all aspects of our business. Engineers in our teams have a strong sense of ownership and drive to innovate and have resounding impact in how we develop and deliver software at such a large scale.

Our team values work-life balance and respect each others time. We use to be located in the Dublin office before the pandemic. This has changed the way we work with some form of work from home and office hybrid forming to support team members where they are currently comfortable working from. We generally keep to core hours from 10am to 6pm, with some members morning and others more night persons. We support a global business and do at times have US meetings that happen at night when really required. We work on keeping them low while making time for Friday afternoon unwinding.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

COVID-19 Considerations

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

We also offer flexibility to work in the office, home, or a combination of both for employees based in their regular country and state/province of employment.

Amazon is an equal opportunities employer. We believe passionately that employing a diverse workforce is central to our success. We make recruiting decisions based on your experience and skills.

Our mission is to make the best mental health tools radically accessible to everyone.

We’re a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University. Our Chairman is Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky is a member of our advisory board, both globally recognized leaders in AI/NLP.

We are poised to redefine how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that’s excited about getting us there. You will be working with modern ML tech such as PyTorch, AWS SageMaker, and Prodigy, as well as Python toolkits like NumPy, pandas, and Hugging Face Transformers.

Giving and receiving feedback with other engineers and having a humble growth mindset.

Become a Key Member of the AI Team


By day 90 you will be able to work with other engineers on feature feasibility and help estimate story points for more complex features.
We work in small teams and value everyone’s opinion. You’ll work directly with product managers, user interaction designers, and graphic designers to provide technical feedback that will help us create the best product for our users.
You'll also write clear story descriptions, craft detailed Github pull requests, and leave code better than you found it.


Growth Opportunity


Beyond Day 90 you will become a thought leader for our NLU, working diligently to improve our understanding of users and to inform product features.
You will find creative ways to work around data limitations such as automated data augmentation and labeling.
You will use your knowledge of linguistics and engineering to help maintain a test suite that ensures a consistent perceived IQ and EQ for Weobot.
Long term, you’ll improve your ability to interface with other teams, write technical design documents, and lead projects from conception to completion.
You will work on regulated medical products that must adhere to the highest quality standards. As a result, you will become a master of your craft, delivering and rigorously testing and measuring NLU features to fully understand capabilities and limitations.


This Might Be Your Next Career Move IF:


You care about helping make quality mental health care realistically accessible to millions of people nationwide
You have experience applying linguistics within a real world product.
You enjoy tracking down and eliminating false positives and false negatives.

Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you’ve got.
Strong work-ethic: You’ve mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

We process payments, run marketplaces, detect fraud, help entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, build world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more. If you’re an infrastructure engineer here, you’ll get to build the systems that power our products.

The Developer Productivity group is responsible for making Stripe’s developers happy and productive. We work on tools, processes, and code refactoring to accelerate Stripe engineering as Stripe scales.

We’re looking for people with an interest in building the tools to improve the day to day experience of Engineers in Stripe. The ideal candidate will have a mix of technical expertise in either language processing tools, version control systems, contract testing, build systems, but most importantly a passion for solving developer experience problems, and a pragmatic ability to ship results iteratively. You’ll be working on a mix of fault tolerant distributed systems and also software which runs on individual developer machines.


Design, build, and maintain the core infrastructure used by all of Stripe’s engineering teams.
Plan for the growth of Stripe’s Engineering workforce. How can the systems and services you maintain be evolved, or transformed, to improve the velocity and happiness of Stripe’s engineering teams?
Build a great customer experience for people using your infrastructure.

To get a concrete idea of what projects you might work on here, see the “Projects you could work on” section.


Think about systems — their edge cases, failure modes, and life-cycles
Know your way around a Unix shell
Can debug complex problems across the whole stack
Focus on the needs of our users, both internal and external
Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production
Are able to write high quality code in a programming language (e.g. Ruby, Java, Go).

It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t come in with as much systems knowledge.

We have a ton of important work to do, which is why we’re hiring!


Plan and implement multi-region availability for our CI infrastructure! All of our systems can sustain losing machines, and making our systems even more resistant to failure is a big theme for us. If you like thinking about distributed systems, you might find a good home here!
Design and implement industry-leading infrastructure to support contract tests. You’ll help define the features and capabilities of the system, including the generation of synthetic data where appropriate. If you like cross-functional collaboration, and solving real-world problems faced by teams striving to reach five 9s of reliability, this is the area for you!
Build fantastic code review tools! If you love helping developers be more effective at their jobs, we have a ton of interesting projects in this area. Related projects: you could help us have better reproducible builds with Bazel and build great developer environments.
Improve the reliability, speed and efficiency of our largest builds. One of the key ways to execute builds efficiently is to bake incrementally into every aspect of the build process. We have accomplished a significant amount in this area, but have a long way to go! Additionally, when an incremental test run consists of a few hundred thousand tests, a handful of bad tests which randomly fail can cause a cascade of build failures. Building and enhancing the system responsible for detecting these will be critical to keep Stripe scaling!

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

Evervault is encryption infrastructure for developers. Engineers build out that core infrastructure; as well as design and create products. Our engineers are not just full-stack, but end-to-end. Our engineers help architect products; build them out; and work with our users to integrate them.




We’re hiring engineers and, in that role, you’ll be making some of the most significant decisions for the company. You’ll get to work with other engineers to build products across the stack; as well as working with our users to understand and solve their pain points.




We’re recruiting engineers who are generalists and are comfortable shipping across the Evervault stack. We’re looking for people with a strong background or interest in building distributed systems and networks. Engineers at Evervault are comfortable in dealing with lots of moving pieces; have exquisite attention to detail; and are comfortable learning new technologies and systems.




You will

Design, build, and maintain software across Evervault’s codebase.
Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale
Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.




You may be a fit for this role if you

Enjoy and have experience building distributed systems and/or networks.
Have 2+ years experience in Software Development.
Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Rust and Node.js, built on AWS. However, we don’t expect you to have production experience in that exact stack: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
Hold yourself and others to a high bar.
Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
Thrive in a collaborative environment with people from different backgrounds. It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For example, our stack includes Rust and Node.js, built on top of AWS — but very few people would have that exact production experience.




You will work on things like

The core challenge for us in building encryption infrastructure is simple: How do we design, architect, and implement globally distributed multi-cloud cryptosystems?
One of the problems we’re solving is how to adaptively prevent data leakage and block HTTP requests to unknown & fraudulent URLs.
Build a way to allow companies to share and combine datasets via Cages.
One of our core focuses over time will be ensuring standardized omni-language support.
How can we build a cohesive ecosystem of integrations so that Evervault is there for developers when they want to encrypt anything, anywhere, anytime?
Building the infrastructure & tools for ingesting and digesting encrypted data will become increasingly important.
While we're singularly focused on building distributed cryptosystems based on standardized cryptography, it's inevitable that we'll implement cutting-edge cryptography in the future.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

At Personio we are on the amazing journey of exponential customer and product growth. After our recent $125M Series D funding we are the most valuable HR tech company in Europe and we are investing heavily in our Technology Platform.




The mission of the Technology Platform tribe is to ensure Personio is built and operated with excellence. We are responsible for ensuring our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and ensuring our engineers have the tools and infrastructure to achieve this. We measure engineering excellence through core metrics of software development delivery. We use these metrics to drive initiatives that enable our peer engineering teams to build, test, deploy, monitor and operate Personio to the highest industry standards.




In the Developer Experience (DX) team, we enable our own developers to build, test and deploy code quickly, easily and reliably on their own. We focus on maximizing engineering effectiveness, by developing and distributing robust and practical development tools, building scalable devops processes, and advocating for software development best practices.

The DX Engineer is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organisation. We support our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, and we play a key role in enabling them to deprecate our monolith and create a highly scalable microservices architecture with modern tech stacks.




Do you get excited about developer tools, build pipelines, continuous delivery and deploying, running and monitoring highly scalable applications on Kubernetes? Are you interested in guiding, helping and sharing knowledge with fellow developers? Are you eager to solve the challenges that engineers face to improve the entire department’s productivity and provide a delightful developer experience? Then this role is for you!




Responsibilities

You will research, engineer and experiment with new ways to improve developer workflows and devops practices to reduce our Lead Time to Production and increase Deployment Frequency
You will maintain and improve Personio’s dev environments and build infrastructure. Your scope will include everything from how services are developed and tested locally, to how they are built and integration-tested using our Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, to how they are rolled out, run and monitored in our production Kubernetes cluster.
You will foster relationships and work closely with product teams to support them in the migration of our monolith to microservices architecture, understand their challenges and propose result-oriented solutions to improve their productivity.
You will also spend time teaching engineers (especially new joiners) how to use our tools, whether by giving internal talks, organising internal onboarding workshops or writing documentation and tutorials.




What you need to succeed

Over 5 years of software engineering experience building and designing scalable applications, tools or distributed systems. You understand the needs of software engineers working in product teams, you’ve been in their shoes, and can empathise with them. You want to help your fellow engineers to achieve maximum efficiency.
You have a strong expertise with at least one of our tech stacks: Java/Kotlin (JVM, Gradle, SpringBoot), PHP (Laravel) or Golang. In particular you’re comfortable with the intricacies of their build ecosystems (build tools, tasks runners, etc.) and you understand how to monitor and manage them in a containerised production environment.
You have a deep understanding and an interest for DevOps tools and technologies such as: Kubernetes, AWS, Sentry, DataDog, Docker, Git/Gitlab, Flagger, and Linkerd, as well as deployment automation (CI/CD pipelines, blue/green and canary deployments).
You’re comfortable writing, documenting and distributing robust and delightful scripts, CLI tools and plugins for developers (we mostly use Golang and Python for that).




You’re interested in development processes and practices (merge requests, approvals, trunk-based vs branch-based development, etc), and are eager to optimise them.
You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services, and you like writing great technical documentation and useful tutorials.
You love data driven decision making and the metrics of Developer Experience - Lead Time and Deployment Frequency.
You have an excellent written and spoken English (level C1/C2 on the CEFR scale)
We are experiencing rapid growth and are “building our plane while flying it” so bring your agile mindset to the table!
You embrace feedback - no one is perfect, neither are we. So let’s make this an opportunity to praise and learn from each other.
Finally, you have a good sense of humour. Have fun with us, learn with us from mistakes and bring your good vibes!"

After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Risk Engineering works to protect Block and our customers from fraud and payment disputes. We keep our customers safe while €20B+ flows through Block annually, and we allow the entire company to take risks and grow. To do this, we build systems to detect and respond to potential fraud threats, provide outstanding tools to agents for investigating fraud events, and give our customers seamless web and mobile experiences to manage and fight payment disputes. Our mission is to protect Block, protect our customers, and make a complicated and sometimes painful process understandable to all.

This is an exciting time for Block as we have recently launched within the Irish market as part of our plans to continue growing our merchant network globally. We’re now looking for multiple full-stack and backend engineers to join our new Risk team in Dublin, Ireland. In this role, you’d be among the first engineers joining the company in Dublin, establishing a team that is committed to keeping our customers safe from fraud and mitigating the impact of financial loss. You’d work closely with other engineering teams, as well as our Risk Operations and Policy team here in Dublin, and you’d work cross-functionally on a global scale to strategize on and deliver the product roadmap. As part of this growth we need to ensure that our protection scales to meet this new demand.

Be one of the original members of a new Risk team responsible for the delivery and success of essential fraud and disputes products and prevention. You’ll be helping to establish the new team’s operating rhythm!
Work with teams across Block, in various locations, to develop new features and improve existing processes.
Build systems that manage customers’ sensitive data and hold Block to the highest standards for security and compliance
See the big picture to design fault-tolerant systems so the team can be brave, move fast, and break things, without ever showing a negative impact to customers
Build great user experiences in both external and internal web applications

5+ years of professional software development experience

6a3cb9569e884da9a12fd55749b7f898,Amazon,"Software Dev Engineer, Amazon Corretto","Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland","DESCRIPTION

The Corretto organisation is looking for senior engineers to join a fast growing team that are launching a new metacircular Java runtime. This new runtime is being used to transform and accelerate hyper-scale workloads across multiple CPU architectures. As part of the team - candidates will design and develop sophisticated metacircular features, including instrumentation and recompilation capabilities. Candidates will contribute to performance optimization and compliance with industry standard JVM specifications.

We are looking for people who have a desire to innovate in the Java runtime, including some native development at the C/C++ level. A strong experience with OpenJDK is essential. Understanding of the changes between major Java releases is valuable. Candidates are expected to demonstrate a high level of competency in both development and knowledge of Java's features and inner workings.

Responsibilities will include contributing to the design of future runtime features, and working with teams and services inside AWS to solve their business challenges using this new Java runtime. Existing deployments of our product must be supported on an on-going basis, and the team will need to address any critical issues in live deployments and debug potential functional/performance regressions. The team has a strong culture of collaboration and co-operation, we are looking for people that work well as part of a team and can also work with customers both inside and outside AWS.

Amazon Corretto is Amazon’s distribution of OpenJDK, used to run our thousands of Java services and also deployed by many AWS customers. The Corretto team is focused on improving OpenJDK for all Java users by focusing on performance, particularly on ARM64 as used by AWS’ Graviton range of processors, and features like the Generational Shenandoah garbage collector. We work with the community to help maintain the Long-Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK as well as contribute to the bleeding edge. We are looking to expand the Corretto team to participate even more in the community and contribute to the long-term success of OpenJDK as a platform.

While Corretto is a relative newcomer to the scene, our team is composed of OpenJDK Authors, Committers, and Reviewers, some with decades of experience in JDK, languages, compilers, and managed runtimes. We learn about where to invest in OpenJDK from running some of the world’s largest Java services. We are firm believers in Open Source and are looking for like-minded people who are interested in working in the open with the community.

EVEN IF YOU ONLY MEET SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS, OR BELIEVE YOU AREN’T EXPERIENCED ENOUGH, WE ARE STILL INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM YOU. We believe that a solid technical foundation and a strong interest in the subject matter can make you successful on the team and we have the opportunities to help you learn and grow in this space. Knowledge and experience in related technologies are generally applicable and valuable.

Java is used for the majority of services in Amazon and nearly all public-facing AWS services. Because of this, we have a vested interest in running the best-possible JDK in areas like security and performance. In 2018, the AWS JDK team migrated Amazon's default JDK to OpenJDK. In order to do this we built rigorous security and quality mechanisms around OpenJDK. We are now able to apply security and Amazon custom patches to the internal OpenJDK as soon as they're available. In early 2019, we took this work public and launched Amazon Corretto, our distribution of OpenJDK. With Corretto, we make our work on OpenJDK available to our customers and the OpenJDK community at large.

AWS has the most services and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. AWS Platform is the glue that holds the AWS ecosystem together. Whether its Identity features such as access management and sign on, cryptography, console, builder & developer tools, and even projects like automating all of our contractual billing systems, AWS Platform is always innovating with the customer in mind. The AWS Platform team sustains over 750 million transactions per second.

Mentor

We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level etc. Your manager can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusion

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work-Life Balance

We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal life.



 Knowledge of language, compiler and/or runtime internals. Java and JDK ideal, but other managed runtimes (such as .NET CLR) are valuable experiences.
 Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field or equivalent experience to a Bachelor's degree based on 3 years of work experience for every 1-year of education.

Come and build the future with us as we change the way the world sees the Cloud!

CloudWatch is a monitoring service built for developers, system operators, site reliability engineers (SRE), and IT managers. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing a unified view of AWS resources, applications and services that run on AWS, and on-premises servers. Customers use CloudWatch to set high resolution alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to optimize their applications, and ensure they are running smoothly. The CloudWatch team in Dublin is growing and we are looking for exceptional software development engineers to create the next generation CloudWatch experience.

Work/Life Balance

CloudWatch values work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Dublin office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm. About half of us come in earlier and the other half of us stay later.

On-Call Responsibility

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Energizing and Interesting Technical Problems

CloudWatch is one of the largest real time data platforms in the world, processing more than 1 quadrillion metric observations per month! This requires teams in CloudWatch to innovate at an unprecedented scale. In CloudWatch we love giving customers what they want: high quality, highly usable, highly available services. It’s humbling and energizing to work with excellent, dedicated engineers to build and deliver world-leading service monitoring solutions at AWS scale.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team has a broad mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

We care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Inclusive Team Culture

Our team is intentional about attracting, developing, and retaining amazing talent from diverse backgrounds. Yes we do get to build a really cool service, but we also think a big reason for that is the inclusive and welcoming culture we try to cultivate every day.

We’re looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with a diverse team of peers; someone who will help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we’ve been building.



 8+ years of non-internship professional software development experience
 Proficiency in, at least, one modern programming language such as C, C++, C#, Java, or Perl, including object-oriented design
 Experience taking a leading role in building complex software systems that have been successfully delivered to customers
 Able to work in a diverse team

If you’re data-driven, interested in building something meaningful and would love to work in an entrepreneurial environment, we can’t wait to hear from you.

You’ll be part of a small frontend team where you will play a key role in helping us create delightful customer experiences in a sound and scalable way.

You'll work on:

The Corretto organisation is looking for senior engineers to join a fast growing team that are launching a new metacircular Java runtime. This new runtime is being used to transform and accelerate hyper-scale workloads across multiple CPU architectures. As part of the team - candidates will design and develop sophisticated metacircular features, including instrumentation and recompilation capabilities. Candidates will contribute to performance optimization and compliance with industry standard JVM specifications.

We are looking for people who have a desire to innovate in the Java runtime, including some native development at the C/C++ level. A strong experience with OpenJDK is essential. Understanding of the changes between major Java releases is valuable. Candidates are expected to demonstrate a high level of competency in both development and knowledge of Java's features and inner workings.

Responsibilities will include contributing to the design of future runtime features, and working with teams and services inside AWS to solve their business challenges using this new Java runtime. Existing deployments of our product must be supported on an on-going basis, and the team will need to address any critical issues in live deployments and debug potential functional/performance regressions. The team has a strong culture of collaboration and co-operation, we are looking for people that work well as part of a team and can also work with customers both inside and outside AWS.

Amazon Corretto is Amazon’s distribution of OpenJDK, used to run our thousands of Java services and also deployed by many AWS customers. The Corretto team is focused on improving OpenJDK for all Java users by focusing on performance, particularly on ARM64 as used by AWS’ Graviton range of processors, and features like the Generational Shenandoah garbage collector. We work with the community to help maintain the Long-Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK as well as contribute to the bleeding edge. We are looking to expand the Corretto team to participate even more in the community and contribute to the long-term success of OpenJDK as a platform.

While Corretto is a relative newcomer to the scene, our team is composed of OpenJDK Authors, Committers, and Reviewers, some with decades of experience in JDK, languages, compilers, and managed runtimes. We learn about where to invest in OpenJDK from running some of the world’s largest Java services. We are firm believers in Open Source and are looking for like-minded people who are interested in working in the open with the community.

EVEN IF YOU ONLY MEET SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS, OR BELIEVE YOU AREN’T EXPERIENCED ENOUGH, WE ARE STILL INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM YOU. We believe that a solid technical foundation and a strong interest in the subject matter can make you successful on the team and we have the opportunities to help you learn and grow in this space. Knowledge and experience in related technologies are generally applicable and valuable.

Java is used for the majority of services in Amazon and nearly all public-facing AWS services. Because of this, we have a vested interest in running the best-possible JDK in areas like security and performance. In 2018, the AWS JDK team migrated Amazon's default JDK to OpenJDK. In order to do this we built rigorous security and quality mechanisms around OpenJDK. We are now able to apply security and Amazon custom patches to the internal OpenJDK as soon as they're available. In early 2019, we took this work public and launched Amazon Corretto, our distribution of OpenJDK. With Corretto, we make our work on OpenJDK available to our customers and the OpenJDK community at large.

AWS has the most services and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. AWS Platform is the glue that holds the AWS ecosystem together. Whether its Identity features such as access management and sign on, cryptography, console, builder & developer tools, and even projects like automating all of our contractual billing systems, AWS Platform is always innovating with the customer in mind. The AWS Platform team sustains over 750 million transactions per second.

Mentor

We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level etc. Your manager can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.

Inclusion

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work-Life Balance

We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal life.



 Knowledge of language, compiler and/or runtime internals. Java and JDK ideal, but other managed runtimes (such as .NET CLR) are valuable experiences.
 Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field or equivalent experience to a Bachelor's degree based on 3 years of work experience for every 1-year of education.
 4+ years professional experience in software development
 Computer Science fundamentals in object-oriented design, data structures, and performance analysis.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together.

In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Amazon's network is growing at an unprecedented pace. Availability of the network for our customers is absolutely critical, and this requires that we drive changes within the network quickly and safely via automation. Keeping pace with the network growth demands that scaling activities – from provisioning, cabling, validation, and integration into the network – require little human involvement.

To drive network change quickly, safely, and effortlessly, we view the network as software and network change as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) of software updates into the network. We are developing the AWS network CI that enables humans to describe the intent of network design and a workflow that integrates those changes with automated testing before release into the network. Network CD takes released changes and continuously deploys them into network.

WHAT? A wave of innovation is bringing sweeping changes to networking technology. Virtualisation, unimaginable scale, hardware commoditisation, and automation are revolutionising network software.

WHERE? At Amazon we push the boundaries in robustness, fault-tolerance and smart adaptive algorithms that can react intelligently to real-world events. Software engineers on our team contribute to every phase of the development process and deploy scalable software systems worldwide.

WHY THERE? Amazon Web Services (AWS) runs one of the biggest networks in the world. We leverage big data technologies and deep network analytics software to drive network automation, performance, and reliability.

WHY CARE? Make history as a software developer at AWS Networking. We develop software at every level of the stack from front-end user interfaces to low-level embedded software and everything in between. We are a highly motivated, co-operative, and fun loving team of software developers who thrive on solving challenging problems and building large-scale distributed software systems.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

All Activities Involving Access To Mastercard Assets, Information, And Networks Comes With An Inherent Risk To The Organization And, Therefore, It Is Expected That Every Person Working For, Or On Behalf Of, Mastercard Is Responsible For Information Security And Must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

If we think CrowdStrike might be the place for you after that we’ll invite you for a technical interview over video call during which we'll discuss building modern web apps, work processes and professional development. This will be followed by a “take-home” exercise and a follow-up session to discuss your submission, after which you’ll get an answer within 3-4 days.

We are looking for Mid- or Senior level Engineers; the title will be dependent on experience and interview performance.


A desire to collaborate closely with users, designers, & testers to deliver quality software that solves problems.
A deep understanding of Javascript and considerable experience building thick-client applications with modern frameworks such as Ember, AngularJS, Backbone or React/Flux.
Experience with testing frameworks, tools and methodologies such as QUnit, Mocha & Selenium.
Functional knowledge & interest in developing accessible interfaces.
Strong HTML & CSS skills, with bonus points for experience with animation, knowledge of approaches to scalable/modular CSS, & preprocessors such as SCSS & LESS.
Familiarity with client-side build processes & tools - Grunt, Gulp, Ember CLI etc
Comfortable with Git/version control workflows.

Experience creating or contributing to open source projects.
Experience with graphics & visualisation tools such as D3 or ThreeJS.

Come and change the way our customers interact with relational database solutions at scale!

The AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is one of the fastest-growing AWS businesses, providing super-simple provisioning and management for relational databases in the cloud. Customers can set up a new database with just a few clicks, and complex administrative tasks like scaling, fail-over, and monitoring are all handled in an automated fashion by our control systems.

As a front end development engineer in the RDS team in Dublin, you will get to design, develop and deploy quality solutions that help external and internal customers interface with the RDS service at scale via graphical interfaces.

Work/Life Balance

Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Dublin offices, but support occasional work from home if needed. We generally keep core in-office hours from 10am to 4pm and provide flexibility for people to structure their working hours around them.

The position involves on-call responsibilities, typically once every 2 weeks. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we prioritise the constant improvement of the operational posture of the solutions we own. When we do get paged, we work together to first mitigate and then resolve the root cause so we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship & Career Growth

Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team has a broad mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.

We also care about your career growth. We try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Inclusive Team Culture

While delivering cool software, our team is intentional about building a climate where respect, equity and positive recognition of differences are cultivated as we think it is the best environment to foster innovation. We are looking for new teammates that are enthusiastic, empathetic and curious and help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we are building.



 You are a full-stack engineer, and have a passion for implementing world-class user interfaces making use of the latest and best web technologies.
 Experience using contemporary front-end web technologies such as: ReactJS, AngularJS, Backbone, NodeJS, SASS, Babel and JSX and testing approaches
 Good command of Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures, design patterns, algorithm design and problem solving
 Knowledge of professional software engineering practises and software development lifecycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing and operations

At Personio we are on the amazing journey of exponential customer and product growth. After our recent $125M Series D funding we are the most valuable HR tech company in Europe and we are investing heavily in our Technology Platform.




The mission of the Technology Platform tribe is to ensure Personio is built and operated with excellence. We are responsible for ensuring our application adheres to the highest technical standards, and ensuring our engineers have the tools and infrastructure to achieve this. We measure engineering excellence through core metrics of software development delivery. We use these metrics to drive initiatives that enable our peer engineering teams to build, test, deploy, monitor and operate Personio to the highest industry standards.




In the Developer Experience (DX) team, we enable our own developers to build, test and deploy code quickly, easily and reliably on their own. We focus on maximizing engineering effectiveness, by developing and distributing robust and practical development tools, building scalable devops processes, and advocating for software development best practices.

The DX Engineer is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organisation. We support our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, and we play a key role in enabling them to deprecate our monolith and create a highly scalable microservices architecture with modern tech stacks.




Do you get excited about developer tools, build pipelines, continuous delivery and deploying, running and monitoring highly scalable applications on Kubernetes? Are you interested in guiding, helping and sharing knowledge with fellow developers? Are you eager to solve the challenges that engineers face to improve the entire department’s productivity and provide a delightful developer experience? Then this role is for you!




Responsibilities

You will research, engineer and experiment with new ways to improve developer workflows and devops practices to reduce our Lead Time to Production and increase Deployment Frequency.
You will maintain and improve Personio’s dev environments and build infrastructure. Your scope will include everything from how services are developed and tested locally, to how they are built and integration-tested using our Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, to how they are rolled out, run and monitored in our production Kubernetes cluster.
As Lead engineer, you will be the main point of contact for other stakeholders (engineering managers, other teams, etc.), and the technical interface for the team. You will be responsible for aligning and leading the team to solve complex problems in the developer experience domain.
You will foster relationships and work closely with product teams to support them in the migration of our monolith to microservices architecture, understand their challenges and propose result-oriented solutions to improve their productivity.
You will also spend time teaching engineers (especially new joiners) how to use our tools, whether by giving internal talks, organising internal onboarding workshops or writing documentation and tutorials.







WHAT YOU NEED TO SUCCEED




Over 7 years of software engineering experience building and designing scalable applications, tools or distributed systems. You understand the needs of software engineers working in product teams, you’ve been in their shoes, and can empathise with them. You want to help your fellow engineers to achieve maximum efficiency.
Over 2 years of experience as a “Senior+” software engineer, with a proven track record of leading software engineering teams to tackle complex problems and coordinating implementation of features with stakeholders.
You have a strong expertise with at least one of our tech stacks: Java/Kotlin (JVM, Gradle, SpringBoot), PHP (Laravel) or Golang. In particular you’re comfortable with the intricacies of their build ecosystems (build tools, tasks runners, etc.) and you understand how to monitor and manage them in a containerised production environment.
You have a deep understanding and an interest for DevOps tools and technologies such as: Kubernetes, AWS, Sentry, DataDog, Docker, Git/Gitlab, Flagger, and Linkerd, as well as deployment automation (CI/CD pipelines, blue/green and canary deployments).
You’re comfortable writing, documenting and distributing robust and delightful scripts, CLI tools and plugins for developers (we mostly use Golang and Python for that).
You’re interested in development processes and practices (merge requests, approvals, trunk-based vs branch-based development, etc), and are eager to optimise them.
You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services, and you like writing great technical documentation and useful tutorials.
You love data driven decision making and the metrics of Developer Experience - Lead Time and Deployment Frequency.
You have an excellent written and spoken English (level C1/C2 on the CEFR scale)
We are experiencing rapid growth and are “building our plane while flying it” so bring your agile mindset to the table!
You embrace feedback - no one is perfect, neither are we. So let’s make this an opportunity to praise and learn from each other.
Finally, you have a good sense of humour. Have fun with us, learn with us from mistakes and bring your good vibes!







WHY PERSONIO

Amazon's network is growing at an unprecedented pace. Availability of the network for our customers is absolutely critical, and this requires that we drive changes within the network quickly and safely via automation. Keeping pace with the network growth demands that scaling activities – from provisioning, cabling, validation, and integration into the network – require little human involvement.

To drive network change quickly, safely, and effortlessly, we view the network as software and network change as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) of software updates into the network. We are developing the AWS network CI that enables humans to describe the intent of network design and a workflow that integrates those changes with automated testing before release into the network. Network CD takes released changes and continuously deploys them into network.

WHAT? A wave of innovation is bringing sweeping changes to networking technology. Virtualisation, unimaginable scale, hardware commoditisation, and automation are revolutionising network software.

WHERE? At Amazon we push the boundaries in robustness, fault-tolerance and smart adaptive algorithms that can react intelligently to real-world events. Software engineers on our team contribute to every phase of the development process and deploy scalable software systems worldwide.

WHY THERE? Amazon Web Services (AWS) runs one of the biggest networks in the world. We leverage big data technologies and deep network analytics software to drive network automation, performance, and reliability.

WHY CARE? Make history as a software developer at AWS Networking. We develop software at every level of the stack from front-end user interfaces to low-level embedded software and everything in between. We are a highly motivated, co-operative, and fun loving team of software developers who thrive on solving challenging problems and building large-scale distributed software systems.

This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in the world, regardless of any location that might be specified above.]

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

Our small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas. Using continuous deployment, we quickly see our changes in the product and make fast iterations. Our engineers focus on creating polished products and writing high quality code by designing APIs and abstractions that are extensible and maintainable.

This team's projects range from building library of reusable UI components, improving frontend debugging tools, making code deploy faster, to optimizing site performance. Recently, this team led large-scale migration of Quora's legacy frontend system to React, GraphQL and Relay , and there is plenty of interesting and impactful challenges to improve our frontend frameworks and systems in this modern architecture.

In this role, you’ll be working with other members of the team across a variety of projects to improve efficiency of product developers. You’ll be working mainly with Python and Javascript, particularly with React, GraphQL and Relay.


Lead initiatives to build and maintain core UI components used by product developers at Quora.
Collaborate with Product Designers and fellow Software Engineers to improve quality of frontend codebase to make product developers more efficient.
Play a major role in team planning by creating actionable plans with proper prioritization.
Provide technical guidance and mentorship to peers, allowing team knowledge to grow.
Understand developer pain points and common questions in frontend development, and aim to improve or answer them.
 Minimum Requirements

Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time). Learn why here 
4+ years of experience working with large scale codebases and systems, particularly web applications and frontend architecture.
4+ years of experience building APIs that are used by large teams.
2+ years of experience working with React and GraphQL, or similar frameworks.

Strong communication and interpersonal skills.
 Preferred Qualifications

Experience optimizing the client-side performance of web applications
Passion for Quora's mission and goals

DESCRIPTION

The AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) team is looking for a Software Engineer who loves to dive in and solve fundamental Computer Science and Systems problems around performance, timing, state machine logic and distributed systems algorithms.

About The Team

The AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) is one of the largest cloud database businesses, providing super-simple provisioning and management for databases in the cloud.

Providing such simplified management for customers comes with the challenge of building sophisticated and reliable control systems. The systems we build manage huge numbers of databases and vast amounts of storage across multiple datacenters world-wide, and our service is growing rapidly, requiring constant innovations in our systems in order to handle the next order of magnitude in service scale.

RDS provides customers with databases that have multiple-nines of durability and availability. Achieving this level of reliability requires building control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle many types of failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate various geographical distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases, multiple database engines (RDS supports MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora), and a wide variety of customer workloads.

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

GitHub is the home for software development, where developers collaborate to build some of the world’s most important software. 
 
 In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from Open Source to the Enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. 
 
 Our team develops and operates the new code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. Code scanning uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and other bugs that testing and day-to-day use have missed. 
 
The opportunity:
 
 Come join our engineering team and help design, develop, and scale GitHub’s new Code Scanning feature. You’ll be working in a full-stack agile engineering team that’s part of the larger code scanning group working in security products. You’ll work with and learn from Senior and Staff engineers as well as influence team and product direction. In addition, we support and reward spending time on improving diversity, inclusion, and belonging, as well as other important improvement-work outside your core role as a software engineer. 
 
 What will your first 3 months look like? 
 
 In the first week on the job, you’ll have deployed your first change to GitHub in production! 
 After 30 days, you’ll be a core part of the team working together with your team-mates on changes and features that are key priorities for GitHub this year. 
 Within the first three months, you’ll have had the opportunity to co-lead one or more features/product-changes that will be included in our next marketed product launch. 



 
 We work as a distributed group within a distributed company. The majority of our team members live in Europe and on the east coast of the US and Canada, and while we do have some offices, all our meetings are location-agnostic and happen online. We operate with a high degree of autonomy and trust, and we have a significant level of influence on the product and technical direction of code scanning, as well as the broader security products at GitHub. We value learning, introspection and reflection, and we’re always looking for ways to improve as a team and as individuals, so candor and a culture that values safety to speak up are highly important to us. 
 
Qualifications:
 
 For this role, we’re looking for an experienced software engineer who 
 
 is passionate about quality, and fostering good engineering practices and processes 
 has experience building web applications in either Ruby or Go 
 has experience with distributed systems 



 
 Additionally, any of the following experiences would be considered a plus: experience with UI development and UX, writing tools or applications for developers, working in remote teams, developing with relational databases, developing on large Ruby on Rails applications, and experience with site reliability engineering or operating software service at scale. 
 
 Please note that this application is for GitHub Engineering and you may have the opportunity to be considered for multiple teams. 
 
 Ability to meet GitHub, customer and/or government security screening requirements are required for this role. These requirements include, but are not limited to the following specialized security screenings: Microsoft Cloud Background Check: This position will be required to pass the Microsoft, GitHub’s parent company, Cloud Screen upon hire /transfer and every two years thereafter.

COVID-19 Considerations

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

About Mastercard

In the US, Mastercard is an inclusive Equal Employment Opportunity employer that considers applicants without regard to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disabled or veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

If you require accommodations or assistance to complete the online application process, please contact reasonable_accommodation@mastercard.com and identify the type of accommodation or assistance you are requesting. Do not include any medical or health information in this email. The Reasonable Accommodations team will respond to your email promptly.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and

Are you someone who likes to collaborate with dozens of microservice development teams, to help them simplify delivery to all major public clouds?

We succeed when we adopt top notch practices and use or develop technologies that are flexible and yet robust. If that sounds like you, you may want to join the Genesys Multicloud SRE team!

Genesys Multicloud is in hypergrowth.

To deliver services that match the Genesys Multicloud reputation, we are seeking the most talented software engineers to build the best services available on the market.

This is the right time to join the Genesys Multicloud team as a talented person who strives to change things for the best! There are always opportunities to make improvements in our systems and processes!

We have hundreds of repos in our GitHub org, and most of them include deployment workflows mostly based on terraform and helm. We have some fragmented pieces of code here and there and need to apply standards and best practices to these. We are constantly improving the way we manage secrets, auditing deployment events and ensuring compliance. What is simple to change in one workflow becomes more complicated at scale, since no workflows are exactly the same.

Our team owns and maintains several in-house GitHub actions and internal services too, so we have some application code to develop as well.

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

They essentially start with a blank canvas and ask the user the question: “what do you want to know?”. A new discipline called “FinOps” has grown around public cloud cost models, focusing on the ability to understand and influence them. At VMware Platform Services, we are defining a new breed of tool that is intuitive and easy to use, so that every public cloud consumer can easily understand their public cloud usage, and can get actionable recommendations to drive resource efficiencies. This system has broad impact and support at VMware, and is an area of significant ongoing research and development.

Within 90 days you will be confidently and self-sufficiently delivering on complex data engineering problems. You will own the design of the underlying data structures and systems.

Within 180 days you will be an expert in the project and be able to work independently on new features and be able to propose new innovations/improvements.

Within the first year you will be making larger changes to the project from start to finish, including designing the change and going through the architectural review process, implementing the changes in small sub-teams and deploying the changes on the platform.

The Work: What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?

COVID-19 Considerations 

We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Responsibilities

All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must

Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices;
Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed;
Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

Achieving this level of reliability requires building control and monitoring systems that automatically detect and handle many types of failures within seconds, and data replication options that accommodate various geographical distribution and disaster recovery objectives. The challenge is further heightened by needing to handle huge numbers of databases, multiple database engines (RDS supports MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora), and a wide variety of customer workloads.
