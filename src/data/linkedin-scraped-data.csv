As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact. Job Description The Payments team at Etsy is committed to crafting and maintaining a resilient, frictionless and scalable payments platform. Available in 43 countries, Etsy Payments enables buyers and sellers to transact in 19 currencies and offers 12 different methods to pay for items on our site. We support the growth and operations of Etsy Payments as an agile and multifaceted product and affords our buyers and sellers the protection they expect. It's an exciting environment with the opportunity to effect change on an Etsy-sized scale! We touch all parts of the Etsy web stack - primarily PHP, MySQL and JavaScript. You'll need to think hard about database transactions, sharding, replication, performance, stability, metrics, integration resiliency and more! You will learn and iterate in a world full of sensitive cardholder data and propose safe and scalable ways to address Etsy’s needs with code on a global scale. This is a full-time position reporting to the Engineering Manager. This person will be located in Dublin or remote from the United States.

As an Etsy employee, youÃ¢ÂÂll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact. Job Description Etsy is seeking a Staff Software Engineer, II to join our International Experience team. We’re a multi-functional group of engineering, product management, design, research, and analytics. Our team has two primary responsibilities. First, ensuring that key product development infrastructure is properly localised such as our internal taxonomy, locale management, formatting libraries, etc. Second, that all products & marketing tools are integrated into our human translation systems, ensuring that Etsy fluently speaks to every buyer and seller in their chosen language. Here’s a taste of the problems we’re solving: How can we ensure that every Etsy product developer can reach a global audience in their language and with their cultural expectations? How can we reduce developer friction in our localisation deployment processes?

Empathy, communication, and technical skill are valued equally. Qualifications You are experienced in both backend and frontend technologies. You have experience working on a large scale, high performance and fault-tolerant systems. You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify. You care as much about building phenomenal products as you do enabling engineers to write great code. You have a “leave it better than you found it” mentality and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write. Have a knack for organization and breaking down large problems into smaller ones. Can be autonomous and a fast learner. You are a mindful, transparent, and communicative technical leader of your team. Can spin yarns about how you've done this right and wrong at your previous job(s). And we'll give bonus points if you can actually spin yarn. Enjoy learning about and interacting with the people who use your product.

4481cd58b81e43b4a69ebe48998ad6af,Esports Technologies,Senior (Backend) Software Engineer,"County Dublin, Ireland Remote","Location - Remote Ireland, or US East Coast Senior (Backend) Software Engineer About Esports Technologies Esports Technologies is developing ground-breaking and engaging wagering products for esports fans and bettors around the world, as one of the leading global providers of esports product, platform, and marketing solutions. Esports Technologies operate a licensed online gambling platform, gogawi.com that offers real money betting on esports events and professional sports from around the world in a secure environment. We are developing esports predictive gaming technologies that allow distribution to both customers and business partner. At Esports Technologies, we are at an exciting rapid growth phase, expanding our business across multiple markets and service offerings and developing our Centres of Excellence (CoE) across Malta as our Marketing CoE, Dublin Ireland and USA our Technology CoE’s. About the role: “Esports Technologies” is looking for a senior (Backend) software developer. We have a huge appetite for growth and need more developers to expedite things. The new developers could specialize in the following areas: Vendor integrations. Take data from a source, convert into a (evolving) internal format and reliably pass into a message bus from where it could be consumed by multiple internal systems. Provide some game-related data (schedule, team roster, etc...) to our customer-facing system or directly to a front-end. There are the short-term areas. Eventually you may transit into development of internal (back-office) system crucial for daily business operations. We Expect That In one monthyou’ll get accustomed to our internal systems and components and create a scaffolding for the application in question (integration or data source) In two monthsyou’ll work with vendors and stakeholders and implement the most valuable features. The application will be in production with the applicable non-functional quality features (reliability, scaling). In six monthsthe original app will be finalized and won’t require much additional work. You will likely switch to another application (in the same or different domain) Role Requirements and Responsibilities: Simply stated – you can create production-level services. The services you’ll be (initially) developing are small in functionality and size, but these should be of the high technical quality. To do that we expect that: You know well at least one programming languageand related tools. We use Python, Scala and Java so knowledge of these (and corresponding libraries) will be good. You don’t have to have a huge amount of experience but should be familiar with common tasks like calling external service over HTTP and storing data in some persistent database. You are open to communicate with stakeholders directly. The services you will be buildingare small and there are no dedicated roles in our teams. We will give you some initial business-level requirements. But then you will have to read vendor documentation, raise potential issues with stakeholders (both business and technical users of the data) and provide some prioritization/planning suggestions based on the unique vendor features. You’ll have a lot of freedom in defining actual backlog and stories. But this means you will have to create and manage tickets yourself and should be comfortable about taking high-level tasks without specific implementation detail. You should be familiar with operational aspects like quality management (usually testing), monitoring and alerting. We’ll help you to onboard with the tools we use if needed and provide suggestions and ideas during development. But you should be able to prioritize metrics, logging and other observability data based on the specifics of your application. In summary – you’ll have a lot of autonomy on how you build the applications. We work in cooperative way and team members will be happy to provide their input and suggestions on what they want from your bit. But you won’t receive a lot of instructions how exactly to implement the component you build. Travel requirements between EU/USA will be required time to time with this role. Must have: The candidate must have a minimum of 3 years industry experience, preferably in a High-Tech or gaming multinational organisation. 3+ years working in a Software engineer role Business process and structure experience to create solid project frameworks for success. Clear and engaging communication skills Ability to work within teams locally and virtually Nice-to-have (but not required): Understanding of distributed systems, their problems and potential solutions Passion for code and application quality Willing to take risks, fail fast and iterate quickly Experience with integrating (consuming or producing data for) third-party vendors Here we welcome and enjoy a positive diverse working environment with every individual working as part of one team to achieve great things together. With our cutting-edge technology we strive to be Best-In-Class in our industry, to our employees and customers. We offer excellent growth, development and career opportunities in a fair and transparent environment. We have a brilliant culture that promotes creativity, autonomy and connecting employees on a variety of projects across our expanding organisation. We are an Employee Centric led organisation who promotes continuous improvements across all aspects of the employee life cycle.

The role Purpose of the Role As a Full Stack developer you will be working in a small international team in Agile / Scrum sprints to help design, build, implement and maintain solutions to support our Software Lifecycle Management team. These solutions, some internal some client-facing, are part of an evolving product stack to help serve our clients and aim to simplify complex product delivery in an easy to use and understandable manner. It is expected that you are communicative, collaborative, flexible and a well-versed web developer. Preferably you would describe yourself as being “full-stack”, but of course you can also have a preference for frontend or backend. How we work: Our Culture Being part of SoftwareONE means we live and breathe our company’s core values, most of all “Customer Focus” and “Speed”. More than that, we have a strong focus on Employee Satisfaction and Integrity, so every single day we ask ourselves and our team members to: Be curious, try things out! If you fail, that’s ok - we don’t blame Embrace change and see challenges as opportunities Prioritize good over perfect - embrace MVP Leave the ego and office politics at the door How we work: Our Technology We build our backends and APIs with Python / Django, and our user-friendly frontends get their interactivity from React and Vue. Together these form a solid basis for the set of applications that we build and maintain for the Software Lifecycle Management team of SoftwareONE. We manage code with Git, using pull requests and code reviews. We use open-source frameworks and libraries, and we contribute to them when necessary or useful. Agile / Scrum For us, Agile / Scrum means: working together and knowing where you stand. You work in a Scrum team together with fellow developers, a product owner and often the (internal) client. Code is reviewed by a colleague and pair programming is warmly encouraged. We adapt Agile / Scrum to work for us, and remain outcome-focused rather than process-wedded. We also support data analysts who work with our platform to perform their analytics, or interact with our clients to collect their data for analysis. Key Responsibilities The right candidate will be an experienced all-round web developer, preferably with front-end and back-end skills. You will be responsible for: Producing clean, efficient code based on input from the Agile / Scrum process. Participate in Spikes to find & test potential solution directions. Develop new applications or make enhancements according to project needs. Fixing, maintaining and improving applications. Support your peers involved in the sprint. Perform code reviews to identify basic technical, logical and collaboration improvements. Estimate project complexity and be able to identify and mitigate risks. Develop best practices to improve productivity. Adhere to company policies and regulatory standards. What We Need To See From You Focus on frontend You have a good feel for UX and design. You are enthusiastic about cutting-edge frontend technologies, and you like React and / or Vue. You probably use VS Code with useful extensions for fast development. You test your code using Jest or Mocha, and it is bundled by Webpack (or by something better, we would also like to hear that). Or maybe you are in a different corner of web development, and you would like to evolve yourself in this direction. What We Expect From Our Employees What you should really know about us.
